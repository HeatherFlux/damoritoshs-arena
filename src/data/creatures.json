The less modified infiltrate communities and act as spies or sleeper agents, while the heavily modded are assassins or troopers handling important missions. Most specialize in hacking and infiltration. They can disable a machine with a thought, but their appearance often fools organics into not perceiving them as a danger. Nobody really knows what the Mechanizers'' goals are. They claim to be ushering in the Singularity, which they believe will come from their wireless network of the same name. Yet their actions baffle observers. Most notorious among these are their (thankfully rare) ritualistic mutilation sprees. More common (and less newsworthy) activities also include performance art, “free upgrades” at cybernetic augmentation clinics, and university seminars. Mechanizer personalities are backed up to the Singularity network, which they believe will be the blueprint for future universal oneness. If a Mechanizer dies, the Singularity generates a new shell for them using recycled parts in one week— perhaps less, if the Mechanizer was in good standing or involved in an important operation.'

Created to guard archives and perform assistive tasks, hardlight dragonets are stockier versions of the creatures they were designed to resemble. Hardlight dragonets are programmed with a draconic enthusiasm for collecting information. They take pride in maintaining encyclopedic knowledge of the archives, databases, and libraries they watch over, and they love to discuss the contents of the files or tomes therein in intimate detail. Clever or deceitful infiltrators use this weakness against a hardlight dragonet, enticing them to spill sensitive information or distracting them from their post while stealthy allies carry out their schemes. Hardlight dragonets and other virtual creatures, such as hardlight scamps and living holograms, might sometimes be trapped within an item a party receives as loot. Sometimes virtual creatures are found on comm units, datapads, or even infesting spell chips. Typically, they've been coded and stored there by a previous owner to act as an assistant or been corrupted by malicious code and unable to function without an Computers check to troubleshoot the issue or hack permissions.

    "rawText": " Xoalat Eons ago, the planet of Eox was a living, breathing world. Though its current necrovite rulers don't care to record the myriad of lifeforms that once flourished there, Eox once hosted countless species of wildlife. Most of these creatures died in the cataclysm that ruined the planet, but some have managed to make the transition to undeath in the time since. Xoalats were once the most popular livestock animals on the continent of Atraskia. Vast ranches farmed these animals in a coastal plains region now known as the Atraskian Shelf. With a single horn and sturdy frame, mature xoalat hides grew into thick braids of hair in many colors that ranchers would harvest for textiles. Xoalats thrive in most environments from arid plains to arctic tundra and consume less feed than typical livestock, as they spend their time rooting in the ground for bugs, weeds, and roots. Every living xoalat perished after the Death Wail rebounded at Eox, but some returned as undead creatures afterward, either woken by undead ranchers or reanimated by ambient necromantic processes. Today, all remaining xoalats are undead, and only a few elebrians own rare items woven from xoalat mane that were passed down through their families for many generations. Rarely, elebrians have allowed these precious heirlooms to be examined by scientists, giving the galaxy the first glimpse of the beauty of xoalat mane textiles in centuries. Xoalats have adapted to the strange necrotic ecosystem that has taken over the Eoxian wilderness. Scientists and sages are baffled by the resurgence of unlife outside the necropolises, where bone sages have carefully cultivate undead ecologies controlled by magic. Only a few secretive Xenowardens have managed to study these blighted environments. As herd animals, xoalats are usually docile, but they can be spooked by the presence of living creatures. When panicked, a xoalat tries to escape to open ground but violently lashes out at anyone or anything in their path to safety.

Frequently observed behaviors include rooting around in the dead Eoxian soil even though they don't need to eat, grazing and roaming in herds, and making a loud mewling sound. Xoalats are generally timid unless spooked, but respond well to undead ranchers. Xoalat Husbandry Undead xoalats have developed the ability to slowly regenerate their bones, marrow, and leathery hides. Instead of cloth and textiles, modern xoalat ranchers harvest samples of bone marrow and hide from their regenerating herds. These materials are valuable to necrograft manufacturers and medical technology companies all over Eox. "

Some rigor mortics are forged from the corpses of Corpse Fleet heroes whose bodies are too broken to continue fighting, but most are amalgams of Corpse Fleet survivors, dead enemies, and living conscripts cruelly forced to endure this fate. Once a collection of parts is grafted permanently into a suit of armor, the final step is coating the rigor mortic in a shell of supernatural ice, turning them into projectiles that can be fired from starship cannons in squads of two to four per shot. These “rigor mortars,” as they've been nicknamed by some fleet captains, are stored in cryohangars until the moment they're loaded into a cannon. The ice melts away during the rigor mortic's flight, releasing the thawed undead from their shell. "

    "rawText": " Phantom Gef Before the end of life on Eox, gefs were a type of domestic animal—a small but robust creature with an enlarged head, sleek quadrupedal body, and fierce loyalty when properly trained. Breeders produced many subspecies of gefs, and they grew in popularity as farm animals, hunting companions, and pets. Boutique breeders pioneered genetically engineered hybrid species of gef with folded ears, bizarre fur patterns, and other sought-after features. These gefs were extremely valuable and became popular pets among the upper echelon of elebrians sages, who claimed their pets also had magical properties. When elite elebrians sought refuge from the escalating sarcesian conflict, they brought their beloved gefs with them. A few gefs survived in underground bunkers, but living pets fell out of favor once the majority of Eoxians made the transition to undeath. The last living gefs were pampered by their owners for the remainders of their natural lives, allowed a peaceful death, and immediately reanimated as undead creatures to continue providing eternal companionship. Phantom gefs are reanimated pets or service animals brought back to unlife by their owners. Most phantom gefs behave similarly to how they did in life. Domesticated gefs retain their training and prefer the company of creatures they bonded with in life. Wild gefs are rare, and are most often strays who form roving packs in the wastelands outside Orphys and elsewhere.

Feral or stray phantom gefs are elusive and rare, but such creatures can be trained by patient hands. Since phantom gefs behave much as they did when alive, common animal training techniques are useful for coaxing these creatures. However, they're still undead and less interested in food than living animals. The hardest part of taming a phantom gef is spotting one. "

    "rawText": " Reculobutapus Reculobutapuses are one of many invasive species from the Vast that hitched a ride into the Pact Worlds and flourished in ecosystems with new food sources and no natural predators. During the Drift Crisis, a Zo! Media crew was stranded in Kazmurg's Absurdity, a relatively uncharted region of space far from the Pact Worlds that can only be explored by studying physical maps. The crew was forced to land on a nearby planet in order to repair their ship and gather the intel necessary to navigate the system. Always looking for an angle, the loyal camera crew followed up-and-coming producer Reculo (ambitious male elebrian producer) into the wilderness to document their experiences. Before the producer was swallowed whole, he managed to capture footage of a curious creature—large, flat, and shaped like a mound of dirt and moss with rows of razor-sharp teeth. A breeding pair of these ferocious creatures managed to sneak into the ship's cargo hull before the crew departed, or perhaps someone smuggled a specimen aboard to sell back home—nobody knows. The transplanted beasts infested Pact Port's hangars, where they wormed their way onto ships bound for other Pact Worlds. The undead of Eox have made the most of their reculobutapus infestation. Once they realized the creatures can be pacified with low jolts of electricity and frequent meals of fresh meat, some necrovites sought after these stylish creatures as pets, prizing them for their ability to change color to match an owner's outfit or home decor—better yet, they provide an extra level of home defense if they aren't fed frequently.

He keeps them as personal pets. Zo! Media funds a breeding project dedicated to breeding a smaller, more docile version of the reculobutapus that could be marketed as a family pet and fashion statement. Reculobutapus Companions Most consider it dangerous to keep monsters as pets, but a few reckless collectors or nature enthusiasts do it anyway. It's difficult to tame and care for a reculobutapus, which weighs up to 2,100 pounds and needs 20 pounds of fresh meat per day to stay healthy. Hungry reculobutapuses regress quickly, forget their training, and carelessly devour their caregivers. However, undead creatures don't make good meals and can usually heal from a reculobutapus mauling, making the prospect of owning such a dangerous creature less daunting. "

    "rawText": " Faceless The faceless are wisps of their former selves, virtually indistinguishable from any other ghost until they tear away their flesh-covered face and reveal the nothingness beneath. Their most noticeable feature is the disconcerting blank space with no ears, eyes, mouth, or nose located where their face should be. Faceless create masks using faces stolen from corpses or even the living, assuming a twisted version of the face's identity until the skin rots away, and they're forced to replace their grisly accessory. Left to their own devices, faceless undead float aimlessly, forlorn and hopeless, until they encounter a face and identity they can steal. Faceless are often drawn to carved or painted faces and sometimes attack other undead creatures. The Corpse Fleet recruits faceless undead to use as shock troops during boarding maneuvers. Some faceless embrace their identity as troopers, serving fearlessly and loyally until they inevitably lose control of themselves, violently tear through their own platoon, and have to be put down by their allies.

Some theologians and scientists believe they're the husk left over after an undead creature's personality breaks down. Faceless don't recall their own origins, and their personalities grow more unstable every time they steal a new face. At least one infamous faceless assassin claimed to be an unidentified victim of a serial killer on Absalom Station. She was found with her face surgically removed and has been searching for a new one ever since. "

He isn't cruel and regrets killing his former friend, but he'll sacrifice anything to preserve this reality. He's willing to discuss his actions and motives with the PCs so long as he thinks they won't try to prevent him from escape. The PCs might not fight Agent Z directly as part of this adventure, but if they do, it's important to remember his power is lofty compared to 1st-level PCs. Consider allowing the party to level up before fighting him. During combat, focus on casting spells that show off his high-level witchwarper powers and present Agent Z as a merciful foe more interested in knocking the PCs unconscious than killing them outright. If Agent Z takes significant damage, if the fight is takinga too long, or if he's in danger of killing a character, he flees, using any means necessary to escape. If the PCs fight him to a draw or lose, he might become a recurring villain the PCs challenge in a later adventure after having a chance to level up and acquire new gear. Alternatively, Agent Z could become an unlikely ally who occasionally teams up with the PCs to fight back against a meddlesome Prime-Facilitator or assist in a mystery the PCs are investigating. Perhaps he could disappear entirely while the PCs pursue other adventures, only to return later with new revelations about the First Ones—it's your story!

Eventually, the glorious Corpse Fleet hopes to conquer all of Desna's Path, and perhaps expand to other galaxies. On the smaller scale of operations, Corpse Fleet researchers experiment with necromantic weapons of all kinds, including unliving biological weapons like mummy wasps. Mummy wasps are created by fumigating wasp swarms inside of their hives and then painstakingly and individually mummifying them in sacred paper wrappings before burying and reviving the whole nest in an unholy ritual. When deployed, mummy wasps viciously attack living creatures and ignore undead, making them an ideal weapon for zone control and enemy suppression. They're also incredibly aggressive and invasive. Mummy wasps have been spotted in locations far from the Corpse Fleet facilities in the Vast where they were created. Mummy wasp nests have been deployed at Barrow and other Corpse Fleet installations. They're also utilized as ammunition, shot out of breaching cannons or hurled from vehicles.

    "rawText": " Sanimus Slayn In the days before the cataclysm that destroyed all life on Eox, Sanimus Slayn was a happy man. He was one of the very rare elebrians who had no magical aptitude whatsoever, but he was very skilled at tinkering with arms and armor and expertly proficient in their use. Sanimus lived on the continent of Atraskia, where he served as the captain of the guard and huntmaster for Lady Elyssiana Taliac, a member of the elebrian nobility who ruled a large fief along the coast of the Deminas Ocean. Lady Elyssiana wasn't ever powerful enough to be counted among the planet's rulers, but as a well-loved personality, she spent much time in their company. She often invited renowned scholars and ruling nobles to arcane symposiums that were as much elite social functions as academic conferences. Fiercely loyal and devilishly handsome, Sanimus became his lady's close confidant and, according to rumor, her primary consort, granting him power and position by association. For his part, Sanimus only cared about his lady. Due to her connections, Elyssiana knew about the impending sarcesian attacks on Eox before they occurred, and she had the subterranean levels of her castle converted into fortified bunkers large enough for her household, staff, and hundreds of people living in the surrounding countryside. She tasked Sanimus with ensuring that the shelter was stocked with provisions and weapons and that everyone inside and outside the castle knew how to safely reach it in case of an attack. When the Death Wail rent the planet, Elyssiana, her entourage, and a few dozen elebrians had already taken shelter along with a pack of hunting gefs. Sensing this attack was different, Sanimus urged Elyssiana to use her magic to peek outside. Horrified, they watched together as the sky burned, the sea boiled, and every creature trapped outside dropped dead. Elyssiana's psyche shattered at the sight of her world's ruination. Shocked by witnessing the death of her home world, Elyssiana withdrew into deep depression. After months of desperation and despair, one of Elyssiana's powerful friends contacted her via sending , revealing he survived the calamity too and had devised a method for salvation. Sanimus didn't understand the complicated ritual the hooded sage transcribed, but he helped Elyssiana follow it to the letter, carefully mixing herbs and oils, reciting prayers that felt unnatural on the tongue, and preparing the needed materials. The truth became apparent far too late to turn back—they'd dosed the rations with poison, killing everyone present, including Sanimus's beloved gefs. Then, the resulting necromantic burst from this terrible sacrifice turned into fuel for a ritual that transformed Elyssiana into a necrovite—a bone sage capable of surviving the apocalypse. Sanimus's fury reanimated him as a corpsefolk, but only after Elyssiana had already departed or succumbed to her own despair. He has searched for centuries but has never found even a trace of her. Over time, he's forgotten who was truly to blame for the tragedy, alternating between hating himself and the bone sage who tricked Elyssiana into performing the necromantic ritual. Now Sanimus serves Shathrava, who also feels guilt about his deeds in the ancient past and foolishly believes only he can put things right. Shathrava has manipulated Sanimus into blaming the sarcesians as the primary culprit for the cataclysm that struck Eox, therefore causing Elyssiana's death and twisted rebirth. Now known as the Skeletal Soldier, Sanimus was among the first to swear fealty to the new Undying Admiral and wields a magic cutlass gifted to him by his new lord—but he still carries the dueling sword Elyssiana gave him long ago. Campaign Role Sanimus Slayn is the primary villain in Guilt of the Grave World . At the campaign's outset, Sanimus is the ranking Corpse Fleet officer stationed on Cairn, a small piece of the Diaspora asteroid belt in the Pact Worlds. This small chunk of rock isn't a permanent Corpse Fleet base. It's a way station responsible for monitoring probe networks spread throughout the Pact Worlds that Corpse Fleet vessels in the area sometimes use to resupply. The listening post under Sanimus's command detected the mysterious signal described in the adventure's background around the same time it was registered by Ulrikka Clanholdings. Sanimus boards his warship, the Amaranth , charging full speed ahead toward the signal, then chases down the PCs as they fled. Once the PCs arrive on Eox, Sanimus sends orders to secret fleet agents and strike teams on the planet's surface to hunt down the PCs and stop them from interfering in the Corpse Fleet's operations. Meanwhile, Sanimus heads to Barrow to pick up a gravimetric towing device that he plans to use to steal the asteroid facility. This time, Sanimus remains behind in the auxiliary research center while the Amaranth returns to the Drift to retrieve the asteroid. Somewhere in his cold dead heart, Sanimus desperately hopes this ancient signal might have something to do with his lost lady. He wants to be the first to learn the truth of this mystery, whatever it turns out to be. Sanimus starts off as a villain operating behind the scenes. The PCs face off against him in Chapter 5. By then, he has already received intelligence about their capabilities and tactics and is prepared to counter them as best he can. He fights with abandon, showing no mercy or quarter. Loyal to the bitter end, Sanimus fights until destroyed. As the collection of miserable bones that he once were clatter to the floor, his weapons cease to glow with unnatural ire, becoming safe for living creatures to handle.

    "rawText": " Zo! The person who would eventually become a galactic superstar, media mogul, and fearsome bone sage wasn't always accustomed to fame and fortune. Born to an unremarkable family of elebrian serfs in rural Eox, Ahmzovar was a precocious child. He showed early signs of arcane aptitude like many of his ancestors, but he also had a flair for drama rarely seen in cerebral elebrian culture. Following his dream to become a world-famous entertainer, Ahmzovar enamored anyone who saw him perform with his sparkling personality and theatrical antics. Many wealthy aristocrats became his patrons, allowing him to travel the world and even amass his own outrageous fortune. Even though Ahmzovar could've simply lived a life of luxury, he stayed connected to his roots, supporting his family and pouring money into public works. Eventually, he was invited to take an active part in the planet's governance, and he quickly became a popular leader among the working class. No matter what projects he involved himself in, Ahmzovar always seemed to make friends across political aisles. Then the trouble with Damiar and Iovo turned everything upside down. Fearful of more sarcesian attacks, Ahmzovar helped fund research into a superweapon, enabling the project that would soon create the Death Wail. The terrible weapon was unveiled alongside a jingoistic song-and-dance routine choreographed by Ahmzovar himself. The performance inspired a near-unanimous vote among Eox's ruling sages to deploy the weapon. When the Death Wail was fired, Ahmzovar watched through a powerful arcane telescope from the tallest tower of one of his castles located on a private island in the southwestern Deminas Ocean, not far from the coast of Atraskia and several new sub-nautical facilities the government had recently finished building. From his privileged viewing platform, Ahmzovar witnessed the energies rebound toward Eox as a shock wave rippled through the planet's upper atmosphere. Sensing something catastrophic about to happen, he activated magical barriers around his estate, saving himself and his retinue from disaster. Trapped on his private island after the cataclysm, Ahmzovar used magical communication to reach out to others who'd survived, and from these exchanges, he learned the extent of the disaster. When his island's resources had finally been stretched to the limit, he tearfully made the decision to leave his staff behind as he made the transition into becoming an undead necrovite since only he had enough power to perform the necessary rites. After the destruction of his world, Ahmzovar fell into a deep melancholy for centuries, remaining in isolation inside his lonely castle as his role in the near extinction of Eox's people weighed on his mind. He blamed himself for the Death Wail's unforeseen consequences. Trapped in denial by grief, Ahmzovar engaged in mental exercises, mind games, and illusionary scenarios over and over and over, trying to figure out some way to atone for his mistakes. His chance would finally come centuries later when news reached him that a sub-nautical facility of yore had been rediscovered, with a population of living elebrians inside! His mind racing at the possibilities of redemption, Ahmzovar returned to public life as Zo!, distancing himself from his former identity and positioning himself to gain control of the newly dubbed Halls of the Living. In the centuries that followed, Zo! reformed the Halls of the Living into a paradise for the elebrians (and eventually others) living there as full- time entertainers while producing content exciting enough to keep the bone sages—and the rest of the galaxy—watching and willing to shell out credits. In his flawed way, Zo! is still a champion of the people. He keeps his past hidden from all but his closest confidants. Zo! is a pacifist who avoids combat, but if forced into a corner, he relies on spells and special talents to survive until he can escape danger. Zo! is one of the original bone sages of Eox, and despite his comedic antics and friendly demeanor, no person in recorded history has ever survived a duel with the undead media mogul. Zo! handles most of his conflicts legally. A team of the best lawyers in the galaxy is at his beck and call should any legal trouble arise. Campaign Role Zo! provides comedic relief during Chapter 3 of Guilt of the Grave World while putting the PCs through their paces as part of an annual Zo! Media Productions extravaganza. At this point in the adventure, Zo! is aloof, playing the role of a famous media personality who's found promising new talent he can hire for cheap, but he doesn't take much of a personal interest in the PCs. Shortly after the PCs' arrival, Zo! learns through his various rumor mills about his rising stars and their run- in with the Corpse Fleet. Once he realizes that the PCs share his interest in living elebrians, he steps in to act as more of a mentor figure for the heroes. Zo! loathes the Corpse Fleet and their depraved mission, so he's more than happy to gift items, pay for services, and sponsor training for the PCs as they prepare to challenge the undead supremacists. Zo! would rather act behind the scenes than get directly involved in the conflict, and no doubt he's already formed several contingency plans in case the PCs fail. Zo!
