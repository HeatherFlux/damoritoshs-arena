Signs of a gubbin infection include computer viruses or glitches that are inane and obnoxious but otherwise harmless. Clangits sometimes steal clothing from larger space station crew members and fashion coveralls or flight suits for themselves.

    "rawText": " Diatha Often called \"boom bugs\" or \"exploding slugs,\" diathas are invertebrates that store nutrients as hydrocarbon chains rather than fat deposits. Threatened diathas secrete hormones that prime their energy stores to combust, detonating themselves to drive off or kill predators. Even if several diathas sacrifice themselves this way, their hive rarely suffers thanks to their rapid reproductive cycle. Diathas are hardy scavengers that can convert almost any carbon-based molecules into energy. Originally, diathas consumed biowaste in underground warrens, but their appetite for hydrocarbon-based fuels and industrial runoff drew them into contact with modernized civilizations, where they quickly adapted to urban environments. Though some entrepreneurs try to use these creatures as an organic means of converting plastic waste into petrol products, most see diathas as vermin that do far more harm than good when allowed to propagate. Diathas can easily stow away in the nooks and crannies of starships, and interstellar travelers often don''t notice them until it''s too late. Because they can digest almost any carbon-containing matter, diathas that colonize new worlds can adapt to a wide range of biomes and persist as a threat to native species for generations. Efforts to eradicate invasive diathas carry substantial risks to the exterminators and the environment they''re trying to protect, as the explosive vermin use literal scorched earth tactics to protect their hives. To make matters worse, diathas are hermaphroditic and can grow new hives from a single organism if they have sufficient food sources to multiply. As a result, the Pact Worlds and Veskarium maintain strict quarantine measures for vessels suspected of carrying diatha infestations. As diathas age, their stored internal gases allow them to become buoyant. These \"elder\" diathas instinctively take prominent roles as scouts and guards for other diathas. To create an elder diatha, apply the aerial and elite adjustments to a diatha, or increase its level using the guidelines from GM Core.

These volatile slicks yield small volumes of workable hydrocarbons and are hazardous to process, so using dead diathas for raw materials is widely considered a survivalist's trick rather than a source of mass-producible biofuels.

The less modified infiltrate communities and act as spies or sleeper agents, while the heavily modded are assassins or troopers handling important missions. Most specialize in hacking and infiltration. They can disable a machine with a thought, but their appearance often fools organics into not perceiving them as a danger. Nobody really knows what the Mechanizers'' goals are. They claim to be ushering in the Singularity, which they believe will come from their wireless network of the same name. Yet their actions baffle observers. Most notorious among these are their (thankfully rare) ritualistic mutilation sprees. More common (and less newsworthy) activities also include performance art, “free upgrades” at cybernetic augmentation clinics, and university seminars. Mechanizer personalities are backed up to the Singularity network, which they believe will be the blueprint for future universal oneness. If a Mechanizer dies, the Singularity generates a new shell for them using recycled parts in one week— perhaps less, if the Mechanizer was in good standing or involved in an important operation.

Cyanoscum derivatives were banned in the Pact Worlds after the toxin was detected as an ingredient in several recalled beauty products, but it's rumored that a ring of unethical aestheticians still uses cyanoscum pigment to achieve a particular hue.

    "rawText": " Hardlight Dragonet Hardlight dragonets vary in appearance depending on their manufacturer's tastes, but many are sculpted with squat, potbellied dragon bodies, sinewy wings, gnarled horns, and spiny tails. Created to guard archives and perform assistive tasks, hardlight dragonets are stockier versions of the creatures they were designed to resemble. Hardlight dragonets are programmed with a draconic enthusiasm for collecting information. They take pride in maintaining encyclopedic knowledge of the archives, databases, and libraries they watch over, and they love to discuss the contents of the files or tomes therein in intimate detail. Clever or deceitful infiltrators use this weakness against a hardlight dragonet, enticing them to spill sensitive information or distracting them from their post while stealthy allies carry out their schemes. Hardlight dragonets and other virtual creatures, such as hardlight scamps and living holograms, might sometimes be trapped within an item a party receives as loot. Sometimes virtual creatures are found on comm units, datapads, or even infesting spell chips. Typically, they've been coded and stored there by a previous owner to act as an assistant or been corrupted by malicious code and unable to function without an Computers check to troubleshoot the issue or hack permissions. On rare occasions, such a creature has infiltrated the computer or item as part of a digital virus. An infected virtual creature might present both benefits and drawbacks to their new associate.

What they lack in raw strength, they make up for with an extensive database of knowledge. Most of these robots are designed to mimic the shape of prevalent humanoid ancestries, and thus the standard configuration for such robots includes two arms and two legs. Some have been modified with extra attachments, providing maps produced from a rectangular opening in their chest plate or featuring touchscreens that allow passersby to consult every ordinance, law, and other legal documents relevant to the area. Some pranksters enjoy leaving doodles and other drawings in spots the robot can't easily detect, and thus an ordinance-class civil robot that has been operating for an extensive period of time can be found with a rainbow of shapes, colors, and the occasional advertisement placed on its back.

When help is needed, an ordinance-class civil robot can wirelessly contact allied robots in the vicinity. The types of robots that commonly respond to the call tend to be security robots, and non-robotic security forces might accompany them. Ordinance-class civil robots have access to criminal databases and are often consulted by bounty hunters to gain information on targets.

    "rawText": " Xoalat Eons ago, the planet of Eox was a living, breathing world. Though its current necrovite rulers don't care to record the myriad of lifeforms that once flourished there, Eox once hosted countless species of wildlife. Most of these creatures died in the cataclysm that ruined the planet, but some have managed to make the transition to undeath in the time since. Xoalats were once the most popular livestock animals on the continent of Atraskia. Vast ranches farmed these animals in a coastal plains region now known as the Atraskian Shelf. With a single horn and sturdy frame, mature xoalat hides grew into thick braids of hair in many colors that ranchers would harvest for textiles. Xoalats thrive in most environments from arid plains to arctic tundra and consume less feed than typical livestock, as they spend their time rooting in the ground for bugs, weeds, and roots. Every living xoalat perished after the Death Wail rebounded at Eox, but some returned as undead creatures afterward, either woken by undead ranchers or reanimated by ambient necromantic processes. Today, all remaining xoalats are undead, and only a few elebrians own rare items woven from xoalat mane that were passed down through their families for many generations. Rarely, elebrians have allowed these precious heirlooms to be examined by scientists, giving the galaxy the first glimpse of the beauty of xoalat mane textiles in centuries. Xoalats have adapted to the strange necrotic ecosystem that has taken over the Eoxian wilderness. Scientists and sages are baffled by the resurgence of unlife outside the necropolises, where bone sages have carefully cultivate undead ecologies controlled by magic. Only a few secretive Xenowardens have managed to study these blighted environments. As herd animals, xoalats are usually docile, but they can be spooked by the presence of living creatures. When panicked, a xoalat tries to escape to open ground but violently lashes out at anyone or anything in their path to safety.

Frequently observed behaviors include rooting around in the dead Eoxian soil even though they don't need to eat, grazing and roaming in herds, and making a loud mewling sound. Xoalats are generally timid unless spooked, but respond well to undead ranchers. Xoalat Husbandry Undead xoalats have developed the ability to slowly regenerate their bones, marrow, and leathery hides. Instead of cloth and textiles, modern xoalat ranchers harvest samples of bone marrow and hide from their regenerating herds. These materials are valuable to necrograft manufacturers and medical technology companies all over Eox. "

Their slinking, hairless blue flesh spreads out into a mane of rubbery tentacles. Despite lacking ears, these quadrupeds stalk prey with an enhanced sight and sense of smell. Akatas typically stand at about 3-1/2 feet tall and weigh 400 pounds. In times of scarcity, akatas ooze noqual from their pores and spin pale green crystalline cocoons capable of holding them in stasis for centuries. They can even use their cocoons to traverse space and find new hosts for their larvae. When a host dies from this infestation, known as void death, the strongest offspring animates the cadaver as a void zombie. Fiercely territorial, they hunt in colonies that are capable of bringing a settlement to its knees within weeks.

The original creature has long since left containment in the Pact Worlds, replicating itself across the cosmos. While often considered a nuisance akin to pests of yore, an assembly ooze left unchecked on a starship or space station can eventually turn into an existential threat. An assembly ooze typically takes the form of an amorphous metallic cube. It has an outer shell composed of a liquid polycarbonate slurry that encases a core of replicating nanobots. The ooze's color can change based on the materials it breaks down, but it's most often a metallic amalgamation of brown or gray. To survive, the ooze attempts to constantly disassemble technological items in following its programmed subroutines then manufacture something new. The nanites within an assembly ooze do have a drive for reproduction, splitting in a process similar to cellular mitosis when the ooze absorbs enough material in a short period of time. Assembly oozes generally don't assault those not carrying the technological items they require as fuel but do lash out to protect themselves.

Wild rumors of assembly oozes working in concert to break down massive junkyards and manufacture whole starships are likely tall tales told by engineers in after-work drinking sessions, but these stories never quite seem to go away.

    "rawText": " Gubbin Gubbins—also known as data gremlins—are spontaneously born from corrupted data, especially as a result of errors in artificial intelligence programs. While gubbins aren't particularly powerful, they're notoriously hard to hit due to the way their bodies flicker and jolt through space as if slightly out of sync with the rest of the world. Gubbins are most easily set apart from other gremlins by their fingers, which vary in number from moment to moment and sprout from illogical locations on their hands, such as the backs or palms. While lacking in fine mobility, their warped hands are disturbing to observe in motion, a fact they delightfully use to their advantage. Due to being weaponized in corporate espionage efforts and later multiplying out of control, gubbins are one of the most ubiquitous types of gremlin on heavily computerized planets. While not as malevolent as other gremlins, gubbins delight in irrevocably corrupting computer data, which they do for their own amusement as well as to create more gubbins. Gubbins are often found where large amounts of data are stored, accompanied by corrupted technological constructs such as hardlight life-forms or robots.

    "rawText": " Kaukariki The poison that laces the barbed tails of the sharp-eared kaukarikis gives them their local nickname, “stingbats.” Thriving in the canopies of warm forests and living in small to large packs, often called clamors, kaukarikis sustain themselves primarily on a mix of toxic and semi-rotten fruit and the occasional venomous insect. While most of their food is poisonous to other creatures, kaukarikis have evolved to turn this poison into a defense mechanism. Their bodies will process poison and store it in a sac at the end of their tail under their stinger. They can then inject this newly created venom into hostile creatures that threaten their pack. Kaukariki clamors are known to use their distinct vocalizations to ward off predators and would-be intruders. When one kaukariki detects a possible threat, they'll let out a trilling whoop, the sound that gives them their name. This signal alerts other nearby kaukarikis, who answer with cries of their own, the cacophony quickly growing in intensity and volume as kaukarikis leap from tree to tree shouting and shrieking. For most predators, the thought of the stinging tails at the other end of those screeches is enough to turn them away, with many clamors relying on this tactic as much as their stingers.

Some rigor mortics are forged from the corpses of Corpse Fleet heroes whose bodies are too broken to continue fighting, but most are amalgams of Corpse Fleet survivors, dead enemies, and living conscripts cruelly forced to endure this fate. Once a collection of parts is grafted permanently into a suit of armor, the final step is coating the rigor mortic in a shell of supernatural ice, turning them into projectiles that can be fired from starship cannons in squads of two to four per shot. These “rigor mortars,” as they've been nicknamed by some fleet captains, are stored in cryohangars until the moment they're loaded into a cannon. The ice melts away during the rigor mortic's flight, releasing the thawed undead from their shell. "

    "rawText": " Void Zombie When an akata bites a humanoid, it infests them with microscopic, parasitic larvae. Those who perish from this parasitization, a condition known as void death, rise again as void zombies. While they resemble a typical rotting corpse, an elongated bluish-gray feeding tendril extends from their shattered lower jaw. When the immature akata within the body senses potential prey, this tendril often undulates and writhes with nauseating eagerness. Once the host body dies, the larvae feed on each other until the strongest makes its way to the victim's brain. After several hours of rapid gestation, it attaches to the brain and infuses it with a mote of necromantic energy. This process leaves the larva ravenous, driving it to consume the blood of living creatures. Void zombies tend to last several weeks as the larva grows, but eventually its host compels it to seek out a safe, secluded place where it can disgorge the larva for one last surge of growth before the host body goes inert. Several hours later, a fully formed akata emerges from the frothing puddle, typically consuming the corpse as its first meal. In general, akatas leave void zombies alone, and the larval parasites attempt to spread out to avoid competing for food. In a confined and undisturbed space, void zombies stand completely still to conserve energy. The juvenile akatas within become dormant and feed on the host body's tissue until they either reach maturity or sense a viable food source. Given the void zombie's relatively short existence, those who stumble upon a previous attack might find the void zombies already devoured or discarded and an eerie colony of silent, glassy cocoons full of ravenous hibernating akatas instead. Void zombies tend to ignore other undead, but they become inexplicably aggressive when confronted with other creatures that are infested by parasites or otherwise controlled or influenced by external forces. Many have tried experimenting with void zombie behavior by forcing them to confront, for example, a rendworm host or a creature under the thrall of a spellcaster. Most such experiments end inconclusively at best, and many have ended in disaster.

Since the creation of a void zombie host is part of an akata's natural life cycle, it's a frequent topic for practicing philosophical debate within her faith. Officially, void zombies and akatas must be destroyed, which is a rare point of agreement between some Eoxians and the church of Pharasma. "

These tall, thin, and spindly creatures appear to have metallic sheens to their smooth skin, often in copper or gold tones. An alloid's surprisingly pliable physiology allows them to mold their physical form to fit into tight spaces or stretch paper-thin against surfaces. It's rumored they can, with great effort, even mimic other people. While few enough people have encountered alloids for the name to truly catch on, they've become colloquially known as “ship stealers” in the Pact Worlds. They frequently travel in groups of three to five, hanging around spaceports and scoping out potential marks. They often look for smaller ships with crews not much larger than their pack or massive ships with many hiding places. They then slip aboard inside containers or backpacks, often during resupply cycles. Once the ship is out in space and the crew settled in, the pack gets to work, ideally taking out their targets one by one with barbs that make their prey's flesh as malleable as their own, allowing them to easily hide the bodies. After kidnapping a crew, they fly the ship to places where they can link up with other alloids—or their Dominion masters—to strip the starship for parts. What they do with their living prey is unknown.

    "rawText": " Electrovore Electrovores consume electricity as their sole source of sustenance. On their native planet, they fed on a species of three-headed electric eels, but volcanic activity wiped out their food source, sending electrovores to the brink of extinction. Electrovores found their salvation when explorers landed on their planet. The explorer's equipment and vessels had ample amounts of the electricity that the electrovores require. They stowed away on the vessels and soon spread throughout the Pact Worlds, causing damage and mayhem wherever they appeared. Nothing terrifies a team of engineers more than finding an electrovore chewing on wires in a remote part of their starship. Where there's one electrovore, a dozen more likely await discovery. These 3-foot-tall reptilian creatures, sometimes called “conduit rats,” breed rapidly and create such a disturbance in power sources that, over the course of days or weeks, a starship or factory might completely shut down from lack of power. There are many lifeless star vessels adrift in space because an electrovore infestation wasn't stopped in time. Removing an infestation is no easy task, as electrovores are single-minded and cunning. The creatures are adept at finding places to hide, stalking their preferred energy sources and finding the correct moment to strike. Packs of electrovores even coordinate feedings in different areas at the same time to make it harder to stop them. When confronted, electrovores rarely fight to the death, preferring to eat some electricity and retreat, hide, and heal, then return for another feast.

Emvermod Source Alien Core pg. 73 Perception +9; low-light vision, modvision (imprecise) 1,000 feet Languages Common, Fey; truespeech Skills Computers +9, Infosphere Lore +11, Stealth +7, Thievery +7 Str +1 Dex +2 Con +2 Int +5 Wis +3 Cha +1 Dutiful Moderator An online community moderated by an emvermod never experiences random bugs or downtime. Any checks to Access Infosphere, Craft virtual items, Earn Income, or Hack using the community as a tool receive a +2 circumstance bonus. If the emvermod is unfriendly, such checks take a –2 circumstance penalty instead. An emvermod must spend a week in an online space to become a moderator. Modvision An emvermod can sense items and creatures with active accounts on any community they moderate as an imprecise sense at the listed range.

It was only a matter of time before overeager spellcasters tinkered with this substance and inadvertently imbued a modicum of life into it, creating yet another strain of ooze to plague the cosmos. These strange oozes exert magnetic powers and have an instinctive desire to seek out sources of electromagnetism. Ferrofluid oozes are considered galactic nuisances, and many shipyards across the Pact Worlds have begun retaining the services of expert “ooze control” agents to ensure these fluids don't impede their day-to-day operations. A common ferrofluid ooze appears as a spiked pool of dark metal liquid that shifts in erratic ways but always reacts to nearby magnetic sources.

These gremlins relish watching other creatures suffer humiliating failure and often spend weeks or longer selecting and grooming a victim into bringing out their own downfall.

    "rawText": " Lumocantha The vibrant appearance of lumocanthas is best observed from a safe distance, as these plants instinctively target creatures that move into their defensive zone who are not plants or tiny creatures. A mane of long, translucent yellow spines surrounds a stamen composed of numerous pulsing, ruby-red, dye-filled capsules. The beauty of their blossoms also contains their most dangerous attributes, forming an organic laser. Lumocanthas seek the light and warmth of the sun, drooping and becoming less active in prolonged darkness. Like many other plants, they employ photosynthesis and absorb water and nutrients through their roots. These unusually strong and flexible roots can also be readily withdrawn from the ground and used for mobility, allowing lumocanthas to migrate as needed as they seek better soil or light conditions. Lumocanthas are mindless, relying on pure instinct for survival. When affected by magical darkness, lumocanthas immediately move toward the nearest light source, though they still defend themselves as they do. If lumocanthas remain in darkness for 3 hours, they start to droop and become sluggish. Even when dormant, they can still use their lasers; however, if trapped in total darkness for 1 week, they temporarily lose their laser abilities. This vulnerability allows the plants to be safely transported, though if kept in total darkness for 2 weeks, lumocanthas eventually starve. Although first documented on Vesk-6, lumocanthas are found throughout the galaxy, wherever suitable conditions exist—even sometimes acting as decorative security measures. Young lumocanthas measure 2 to 3 feet across and approximately 5 feet high when unfurled in the light. When allowed to thrive, lumocanthas can live for several hundred years and grow up to 20 feet high.

For those who succeed, the financial and social gains are substantial. Lumocantha dye is prized in several industries, including textiles, weapons, and industrial lasers, and as a component of alarm systems and other tagging mechanisms. None have been able to fully replicate the qualities of the dye produced by nature. "

They were bred into near domestication for their relatively small size and powerful inhaling maw. Frontier colonies and deep-space exploration firms often rely on ravenous drakes instead of felines or other pest-control creatures. When found in the wild, ravenous drakes are familial and fiercely territorial, often roving in large packs.

Due to the native Azhans'' propensity for trading, these creatures have made their way across the cosmos and found new homes in the galaxy''s various wetlands. Zitterocs are renowned across the galaxy for their ability to innately detect and somehow ignore even the most virulent poisons. They can siphon such poisons from targets and convert them into a fuel source for their digestive acids. Even after this siphoning process, trace amounts of poison can be found within a zitteroc, and the fresh bodies of zitterocs are often a cornucopia of medicinal substances for biotechnicians and pharmaceutical experts. At maturity, a zitteroc stands only 2 to 3 feet tall, with a length roughly double that size. They possess a sickly blue hide that shimmers like an oil slick and can take on the rough properties of its surroundings with concentration. Additionally, they can feign a sickening death when threatened by hunters or more dangerous predators. These typically docile carnivores can become vicious when they run out of abundant food from less threatening animals, at which point they make their way into the fringes of civilization.

On Azhan Prime, the creatures were a mid-tier predator that kept the smaller wildlife in the boglands of that world contained.

Copi contain hollows that collapse matter into dense stores, creating pressurized chambers that emulate black holes. Corchaazes break down copi with their claws and add the material to their shells, creating gravity wells on their bodies. Corchaazes are effectively immortal unless they die of injury or illness. Legend has it their shells continue to grow as they age—copaxi folk tales describe corchaazes as big as islands. A coastal shelf collapse on Tabrid Minor in 322 AG destroyed the planet's major corchaaz spawning ground, but this wasn't the end for this hardy species. In 324 AG, a team of scientists in a nearby star system noticed wildly fluctuating gravimetric readings. Following the weird readings, the scientists discovered and tracked a group of corchaazes traveling along a local Drift lane. Corchaaz migrations were new, and many scientists were eager to study rafts, as the migratory groups were called.

    "rawText": " Phantom Gef Before the end of life on Eox, gefs were a type of domestic animal—a small but robust creature with an enlarged head, sleek quadrupedal body, and fierce loyalty when properly trained. Breeders produced many subspecies of gefs, and they grew in popularity as farm animals, hunting companions, and pets. Boutique breeders pioneered genetically engineered hybrid species of gef with folded ears, bizarre fur patterns, and other sought-after features. These gefs were extremely valuable and became popular pets among the upper echelon of elebrians sages, who claimed their pets also had magical properties. When elite elebrians sought refuge from the escalating sarcesian conflict, they brought their beloved gefs with them. A few gefs survived in underground bunkers, but living pets fell out of favor once the majority of Eoxians made the transition to undeath. The last living gefs were pampered by their owners for the remainders of their natural lives, allowed a peaceful death, and immediately reanimated as undead creatures to continue providing eternal companionship. Phantom gefs are reanimated pets or service animals brought back to unlife by their owners. Most phantom gefs behave similarly to how they did in life. Domesticated gefs retain their training and prefer the company of creatures they bonded with in life. Wild gefs are rare, and are most often strays who form roving packs in the wastelands outside Orphys and elsewhere.

Feral or stray phantom gefs are elusive and rare, but such creatures can be trained by patient hands. Since phantom gefs behave much as they did when alive, common animal training techniques are useful for coaxing these creatures. However, they're still undead and less interested in food than living animals. The hardest part of taming a phantom gef is spotting one. "

    "rawText": " Reculobutapus Reculobutapuses are one of many invasive species from the Vast that hitched a ride into the Pact Worlds and flourished in ecosystems with new food sources and no natural predators. During the Drift Crisis, a Zo! Media crew was stranded in Kazmurg's Absurdity, a relatively uncharted region of space far from the Pact Worlds that can only be explored by studying physical maps. The crew was forced to land on a nearby planet in order to repair their ship and gather the intel necessary to navigate the system. Always looking for an angle, the loyal camera crew followed up-and-coming producer Reculo (ambitious male elebrian producer) into the wilderness to document their experiences. Before the producer was swallowed whole, he managed to capture footage of a curious creature—large, flat, and shaped like a mound of dirt and moss with rows of razor-sharp teeth. A breeding pair of these ferocious creatures managed to sneak into the ship's cargo hull before the crew departed, or perhaps someone smuggled a specimen aboard to sell back home—nobody knows. The transplanted beasts infested Pact Port's hangars, where they wormed their way onto ships bound for other Pact Worlds. The undead of Eox have made the most of their reculobutapus infestation. Once they realized the creatures can be pacified with low jolts of electricity and frequent meals of fresh meat, some necrovites sought after these stylish creatures as pets, prizing them for their ability to change color to match an owner's outfit or home decor—better yet, they provide an extra level of home defense if they aren't fed frequently.

He keeps them as personal pets. Zo! Media funds a breeding project dedicated to breeding a smaller, more docile version of the reculobutapus that could be marketed as a family pet and fashion statement. Reculobutapus Companions Most consider it dangerous to keep monsters as pets, but a few reckless collectors or nature enthusiasts do it anyway. It's difficult to tame and care for a reculobutapus, which weighs up to 2,100 pounds and needs 20 pounds of fresh meat per day to stay healthy. Hungry reculobutapuses regress quickly, forget their training, and carelessly devour their caregivers. However, undead creatures don't make good meals and can usually heal from a reculobutapus mauling, making the prospect of owning such a dangerous creature less daunting. "

    "rawText": " Zalyop The jet streams of the gas giant Bretheda are filled with large, bulbous silhouettes called zalyops, sometimes referred to as balloon plants. Gas-filled and hardy, they're buffeted around by the planet's eternal storms. It's common for a cascade of these plants to be found trailing in the wake of an oma or plastered against one of the many spacecrafts and aircrafts frequenting the gas giant. The sound of zalyops bouncing against a metal hull at high velocity can be a humorous one, but travelers should be careful not to assume these plants are harmless. Zalyops are known to expel high-speed organic shrapnel by reflex. Additionally, their confusion-inducing gaseous waste easily spreads across the atmosphere and can be caught in a ship's air-intake valve. Zalyops can also cause chaos at ground level. When they float into small settlements, flocks of them will descend on small creatures, which they engulf for nutrients. The widespread befuddling clouds caused by such incursions are a dangerous nuisance. Pedestrians and pets alike must take care during such events to stay inside and simply wait the invasive balloons out. Pact Worlds chemists have developed (and patented) Balyoon, an anesthetic drug from zalyop gases. In addition to being difficult to obtain in the first place, the drug is highly unstable until refined in the laboratory, and more than one starship has been lost when its crew failed to properly store the gases they just harvested from a zalyop. Balyoon also plays a role in Eoxian soap operas and other dramatic vidshows across the Pact Worlds. It's used as a plot device in a myriad of ways, such as a villain contriving to discredit a hero or for a family member to suddenly lose their mind or memory in a soap opera. How these characters obtained the processed gas of a predatory Brethedan plant is rarely as important as the exciting drama, however.

Ship's doctor skimped on the medical budget? Or maybe you're just a volunteer test subject in a lab with bigger dreams than funding sources. If so, you've likely been given Balyoon while strapped down to an examination table. Balyoon is a mild anesthetic distilled from the gaseous emanations of zalyops. Side effects include nausea, headaches, euphoria, memory loss, and the propensity to lash out at nearby creatures, but it still works in a pinch. "

    "rawText": " Crest-Eater Crest-eaters are large four-legged beasts with traits of both reptiles and mammals. Originating from the distant world of Kasath, they've spread throughout the cosmos, accompanying numerous kasathas and even having a small enclave aboard the Idari worldship in the Pact Worlds. A crest-eater is a predator known for consuming the bones of their prey. They use a highly corrosive acidic venom that eats through minerals with ease. Their name comes from their history of tracking down kasathas and cracking open their prey's elongated skulls to feed on the “bony crests” within. As crest-eaters consume bones and other substances, they produce large mineral protrusions across their bodies. Crest-eaters are social creatures and often form prides to hunt together or join with other nearby species if they're accepted—it's not uncommon to find a starship crew or local raider gang with one or more crest-eaters they've adopted. Tamers who have hunted with crest-eaters for generations craft a ceremonial cestus from their comrade's body after a crest-eater passes, a tradition still practiced to this day despite the high value and demand for crest-eater bones. Most crest-eaters can grow as long as 14 feet and about 6 feet tall (not including their noticeable mineral protrusions). Thanks to their mineral-laden composition, they often weigh in excess of 1,000 pounds, somewhat hampering their mobility in environments that can't support their girth. Young and mature crest-eaters tend to stay together in small prides, though some act as solitary hunters in environments where food sources are scarce. Especially large males frequently become increasingly aggressive as they age, and they're often driven away by the rest of the pride for both their hostility and gluttonous appetites. If these solitary beasts survive long enough, they can become unpredictable and dangerous threats that attempt to establish territory and find food by attacking desert settlements. Many kasathan epics feature one or more brave warriors defending their village against an ancient male crest-eater. Whether dispatched by local legends or eventually dying off in secret, these oversized crest-eaters can leave behind a valuable cache of minerals for enterprising adventurers.

Ages ago, kasathas from old Kasath studied these crystalline compounds, and they've since become the basis of kasathan solar technology. Some crest-eaters, given ready access to sunlight and vast fields of bone, gorge themselves to excess. Such specimens become truly immense and territorial, and it's believed several bone fields on old Kasath are protected by such vast guardians, who have become local legends to the kasathas who remained behind.

Some emissars spring from the sainted souls of revolutionary leaders or celebrities who used their platforms to help people in life, having been transformed into a celestial in their afterlife. Others spontaneously form out of the condensed faith and desires of a movement or ideal. Emissar angels take on the role of celestial spin doctors and political organizers, inspiring their allies to rally together and keep pushing toward a goal even when defeat seems inevitable. Emissars often support mortal causes that align with their own beliefs and goals, and while they always hope to change hearts with an inspiring speech or an act of radical kindness, emissars aren't afraid to fight for what they believe in—no matter the cost to themselves. As soon as a battle ends, their first priority is caring for their allies and saving any enemies who might be swayed to join the cause.

    "rawText": " Excuba Unlike all other known types of spectra, excuba spectra are fragmented creatures made of countless tiny pieces that act together as a single networked whole. No accounts of an excuba encounter exist before the Drift crashed, and prevailing theories hold that either the trauma of the crisis created them, or they were created by the Drift as a response to the crisis itself. Whatever the case, excuba encounters have become all too common. These spectra swarms are often dispatched to infiltrate mortal worlds as spies or observers. They collect information for more powerful spectra like wyspirias to analyze and preserve. Some speculate that excubas have always lurked in the galaxy as invisible spies for other spectra, and that the Drift Crisis merely caused them to take a new, less cohesive form.

In addition, the excuba can use any item or creature with the tech trait within their digital telepathy aura as the point of origin for their spells and abilities when calculating range, distance, line of effect, and area of effect.

An excuba can enter or exit the drift themself as a 1-minute activity.

    "rawText": " Faceless The faceless are wisps of their former selves, virtually indistinguishable from any other ghost until they tear away their flesh-covered face and reveal the nothingness beneath. Their most noticeable feature is the disconcerting blank space with no ears, eyes, mouth, or nose located where their face should be. Faceless create masks using faces stolen from corpses or even the living, assuming a twisted version of the face's identity until the skin rots away, and they're forced to replace their grisly accessory. Left to their own devices, faceless undead float aimlessly, forlorn and hopeless, until they encounter a face and identity they can steal. Faceless are often drawn to carved or painted faces and sometimes attack other undead creatures. The Corpse Fleet recruits faceless undead to use as shock troops during boarding maneuvers. Some faceless embrace their identity as troopers, serving fearlessly and loyally until they inevitably lose control of themselves, violently tear through their own platoon, and have to be put down by their allies.

Faceless don't recall their own origins, and their personalities grow more unstable every time they steal a new face. At least one infamous faceless assassin claimed to be an unidentified victim of a serial killer on Absalom Station.

    "rawText": " Flayer Leech Flayer leeches are tiny, invertebrate hunters with multi-hinged mouths that have developed an interesting life cycle: they wear their victim's skin to pose as them, consuming their innards to reproduce. Flayer leeches will kill and feed on living creatures, feasting on the bone marrow of their victims. This consumption gives them sustenance to survive for weeks. Flayer leeches disengage the tendrils of their petallike mouths, extending them up to 2 meters and using them to stitch together a prey's remains, leaving the brain for it to consume. They then use these tendrils as a pseudo-skeleton to give structure to the body and move it, allowing them to convincingly reanimate the corpse and take on its movements and previous life. The flayer leech lacks the corpse's specific memories, however, which can make it easy to spot for those familiar with the leech's victim. Flayer leeches use this disguise as a safe harbor while feeding off the remaining marrow and nervous system and will defend these new bodies like their home.

This practice has stopped not because of its macabre nature, but because it always ends up with a murderous flayer leech running loose. "

These 12-foot-long quadrupeds have up to a dozen face tentacles and see through two eyestalks that protrude from either side of the tentacular mass. Ksariks' mutable forms might temporarily develop webbing, wings, and other adaptations after they siphon off genetic code from their prey. Originally scavengers, ksariks have evolved into deadly hunters capable of weaponizing their digestive and reproductive systems. The internal acid ksariks use to digest prey can be projected as lethal spittle. The dozens of thorns along their sides carry their genetic code and can be launched as projectiles, allowing ksarik saplings to feed off a victim as they grow. This easy transmittal of their young and their environmental adaptability have allowed ksariks to spread far beyond Castrovel.

In theory, this could lead to permanent changes when a ksarik repeats the same adaptation enough times. For instance, a ksarik that consumes a lot of amphibious or aquatic wildlife might permanently gain the amphibious or aquatic trait. Rumors of specimens with leafy wings or fiery mucus further support this hypothesis, and some believe they could “train” a ksarik for a specific purpose if they expose the creature to the right stimuli.

    "rawText": " Sapient Purple Orb Purple orbs are curious, social beings who unfailingly attempt to make contact with any life-form they encounter, though these attempts are frequently inept. Few other creatures understand their ancient language, so purple orbs instead use magic, telepathy, minor illusions, and flashes of light and flowing mist from their 3-foot-diameter luminous bodies. Purple orbs are eager for cooperation and solidarity with their chosen friends and family, whether those are other sapient orbs or completely different beings, making it relatively easy to befriend them—or deceive them. Purple orbs are devout supporters and defenders of their companions, flinging themselves bodily into the fray if a friend is in danger. They become a deep dark purple as they grow more emotional in the heat of conflict (violent or otherwise), though their emotions rarely grow so intense that they're willing to take another being's life. That purple orbs seem to value their own lives less than those of their friends might be among the reasons that the number of sapient purple orbs in the universe seems to be dwindling.

Since many asteroids exist near one another in asteroid belts, sterieids are more likely to form communities among their own kind than other nymphs. Conversely, they tend to be wary of outsiders, despite visitors being less of a novelty. Those sterieids who desire company, however, build way stations on their asteroids for passing starships, offering food, amenities, and information about the local system. Mining is a contentious issue for sterieids, who usually react with hostility to such operations.

    "rawText": " Vracinea The vracinea is a large, shambling, multi-mawed plant, originally native to Castrovel but now found on many more planets. Slow and clumsy, it prefers to lure animals and other protein-rich prey with its blossoms. It then seeks to make a quick kill while the prey is befuddled by its spores. Though the paralytic effect of a vracinea's spores isn't potent at great distances, when these spores catch the wind, they help the plant spread to new habitats. A vracinea is a particularly cunning and territorial hunter that knows how to use local hazards. It's skilled at hiding its body in the underbrush, extending just its blossoms to lure in prey.

Studies are still being performed on the spores' abilities to survive the long journeys after attaching to a victim's clothes. "

    "rawText": " Agent Z Agent Z is the campaign's primary antagonist, working behind the scenes and occasionally disrupting the PCs' activities. He isn't cruel and regrets killing his former friend, but he'll sacrifice anything to preserve this reality. He's willing to discuss his actions and motives with the PCs so long as he thinks they won't try to prevent him from escape. The PCs might not fight Agent Z directly as part of this adventure, but if they do, it's important to remember his power is lofty compared to 1st-level PCs. Consider allowing the party to level up before fighting him. During combat, focus on casting spells that show off his high-level witchwarper powers and present Agent Z as a merciful foe more interested in knocking the PCs unconscious than killing them outright. If Agent Z takes significant damage, if the fight is takinga too long, or if he's in danger of killing a character, he flees, using any means necessary to escape. If the PCs fight him to a draw or lose, he might become a recurring villain the PCs challenge in a later adventure after having a chance to level up and acquire new gear. Alternatively, Agent Z could become an unlikely ally who occasionally teams up with the PCs to fight back against a meddlesome Prime-Facilitator or assist in a mystery the PCs are investigating. Perhaps he could disappear entirely while the PCs pursue other adventures, only to return later with new revelations about the First Ones—it's your story!

    "rawText": " Cerebinite The mineral cerebinium, also known as memory crystal, naturally appears in the broken region of space known as Kazmurg's Absurdity. Typically, these minerals develop in remote subterranean locations, where they grow based on the presence of thinking minds within a planetary range. The more active minds in a region, the faster these mineral formations grow. A major world of millions can easily create vast underground stores, and in these majestic caverns, cerebinites spontaneously emerge. Cerebinites are essentially mindless creatures—save for the memories that power them—who have developed as an offshoot of cerebinium growth. Though possessing no intellect of their own, they act off the impulses provided by the memories stored within the crystals that constitute their forms. In many ways, a cerebinite is like the many oozes that lie in wait throughout the cosmos. Encountering these active mineral deposits often requires a delicate approach, as cerebinites can engage up close or at a short range by hurling cerebinium spikes and blasts of cerebinium shards charged with memories drawn from their surroundings. Even in death, these masses of cerebinium explode in a destructive burst of psychic energy, affecting the minds of those nearby with jumbled visions of countless different lives. When multiple injured cerebinites gather near one another, this proximity can cause an especially destructive chain reaction due to cerebinites' own susceptibility to mental attacks.

Magical scholars and experts pay premium for memories that might find them exploiting a weakness in a foe or learning the history of some long-dead culture.

Dredgelits are the undead specters of deceased media megastars who haunt the venues of their former glories and crave the attention of forgetful fans. Most dredgelits live in a fantasy version of their former lives, but once their delusions are shattered, a burning desire to recapture their lost fame drives them. At this point, they become unpredictable, and even the smallest perceived slight can lead to a murderous fit of rage. Dredgelits embody their former stage personas. These decaying debutantes ensnare admirers into their eternal fan clubs, blissfully unaware of the life-draining consequences they have upon new admirers. Dredgelit seek sacrificial fans, luring in the unwary and draining their vitality to stay famous and fabulous forever.

They're easy to manipulate with flattery and lies.

    "rawText": " Ignurso Adventurers exploring active geothermal areas might encounter one of the extreme habitat's most unique creatures: ignursos. These ursine burrowers are partially armored with scales and a fearsome horn. They're sedentary by nature, but when disturbed, their rage combines the ferocity of a bear mauling with the heat of a pyroclastic flow. Ignursos are specially adapted to survive in extremely hot climates but thrive anywhere warm. Those that inhabit less hospitable planets tend to stay underground and hibernate during the coldest parts of the year. Scavengers by nature, ignursos can't take their next meal for granted. However, these clever creatures can manipulate their environment to trap prey. Ignursos have been observed creating large networks of burrows right before volcanic eruptions, seemingly because they understand lava flows will follow this path of least resistance. These tunnels turn to rivers of red-hot lava perfectly positioned to strand fleeing wildlife. Ignursos then return for their spoils after the worst of the eruption has passed. Ignursos have a significant impact on volcanic ecosystems. Burrowing ignursos break up solid rock—often freshly deposited after an eruption—kick-starting the process of soil formation that's necessary for the return of plants. Some dig too close to underground magma chambers, turning their tunnels into volcanic vents that release lava and gases. In this way, they make explosive, damaging eruptions much less likely and provide a moderating force on a harsh environment.

Since ignursos generate abrasive rock dust and dwell in fiery environments, they evolved a majestic horn that helps block debris and a protective nictitating membrane. "

It can also lead to the creation of the foul undead known as nihilis. A nihili arises after an individual in vacuum dies of asphyxiation while all gases exit their body and their lungs collapse from attempts to hold their breath. Legends say the first person to die in such a terrible manner had a vision of the goddess of undeath, Urgathoa, who bestowed upon them a single kiss, transforming them into the very first nihili. The same legends go on to claim that this nihili still floats aimlessly through space, waiting to cling to an unsuspecting starship. The physical appearance of a given nihili varies. Most appear as zombie-like versions of their respective ancestries, but with gruesome stretch marks and pockets of bloat caused by escaping gases during their death. A nihili maintains their prior intellect, subverted entirely to inflicting the same suffering on the living that they endured. By focusing their gaze on a target, a nihili can impart to that creature the memories of their own demise, potentially suffocating them.

Grimly called “the last gasp,” the wire serves as a backup if communications are severed, and the station suspects a crewmate is dead. Modern armor, communication equipment, and spacewalk procedures make it unlikely that an astronaut will become a nihili while repairing the hull of a ship or station. But nihili are so feared that there have been cases of bodies sent floating into space rather than risk a nihili being brought aboard and propagating itself by decompressing an entire station. "

A trawler can spin a filament with sticky coating that has a mild anesthetic effect, allowing them to stalk at a distance and then pull their prey in close, all while comfortably airborne. It's extremely rare for an adult trawler to land or alight on anything voluntarily. Usually, they maintain at least a minimal air gap between themself and any object. If forced to be on the ground, a trawler can use their tentacles to clumsily ambulate, though more often than not, they'll launch themself into the air given the first opportunity.

Trawlers lay their eggs in protected saltwater coves. The hatchlings remain in the water for 7 to 8 months before clambering their way onto tide pool rocks for a brief amphibious phase as they transition from water-breathing to air-breathing creatures. Once the transition is complete, they release their grip, catching the seasonal winds to become permanently sky-bound, except for regular egg-laying cycles. "

They operate in the cities of Malfane and the watery planet Embroi and, increasingly, attend meetings with corporate legal teams in Near Space. Trained in negotiation, business administration, and the corporate buzzwords of a hundred cultures, wahtunshnas offer a competitive advantage to corporations while building a reputation of their own. The knowledge and industrial power of Hell are tempting to many companies looking to get an edge over their competitors, and wahtunshnas are more than happy to assist. In exchange for the incorporation of spyware into their products and Diabolic clauses in their terms of service, corporations gain access to the intellectual property of Hell, passing on infernal bloatware to their customers.

Their most striking feature is a mass of wriggling, semi-sentient appendages that cover their heads. Each of these tentacle-like protuberances contains a bloodshot eyeball and a gaping mouth full of teeth, and the caypin— which has no eyes or mouth of its own—relies on these orifices to see and feed. Nutrients absorbed by the appendages are passed to the caypin via tiny receptive sockets in the beast's jaw, and caypins can detach these appendages into writhing clusters that independently move up to 100 feet from their bodies. In the wild, caypins use these clusters to ambush prey, and the creatures are known across the galaxy for their rapacious ability to consume half of their body weight in raw meat.

The Insatiable Eclipse amasses its forces, including legions of draiclipsed, to retake Eox, a world he feels has fallen to decadence and frivolity, whose disgraceful leaders have made the blasphemous decision to ally with the living. Draiclipsed are canny skeletal undead whose pitch-black bones absorb light, allowing them to cast deep shadows. They can also consume magical light, using the absorbed photons to obscure their form before unleashing it in a blast of electromagnetic energy.

Eventually, the glorious Corpse Fleet hopes to conquer all of Desna's Path, and perhaps expand to other galaxies. On the smaller scale of operations, Corpse Fleet researchers experiment with necromantic weapons of all kinds, including unliving biological weapons like mummy wasps. Mummy wasps are created by fumigating wasp swarms inside of their hives and then painstakingly and individually mummifying them in sacred paper wrappings before burying and reviving the whole nest in an unholy ritual. When deployed, mummy wasps viciously attack living creatures and ignore undead, making them an ideal weapon for zone control and enemy suppression. They're also incredibly aggressive and invasive. Mummy wasps have been spotted in locations far from the Corpse Fleet facilities in the Vast where they were created. Mummy wasp nests have been deployed at Barrow and other Corpse Fleet installations. They're also utilized as ammunition, shot out of breaching cannons or hurled from vehicles.

This appearance is, however, a ploy meant to lure unsuspecting creatures into their grasp. Their true form is a two-headed twisted knot of flesh with eyeless sockets and gaping maws dripping with acid—and they're far from helpless. Quyus can live without air, food, or water indefinitely. They have a dangerous combination of bottomless curiosity and complete lack of concern for other species' well-being. They originate from a now-Diasporan asteroid, though due to their disguises, they've spread to countless planets undetected, where they hunt and dissect creatures for their sadistic pursuits. These solitary creatures prefer to observe an area's wild and domesticated species before infiltrating the peripheries of a civilization. There, they establish quiet cover identities, often as children's pets, only to capture and vivisect unsuspecting victims. Quyus take on whatever appearance they believe is most likely to be considered cute by whatever beings inhabit their environments, even if the creature they mimic has no place in the world's ecology. They might take on the form of an adorable, mundane cat, rabbit, or similar fluffy creature, even in the middle of an asteroid mine or in the deep sea.

    "rawText": " Sapient Green Orb Sapient green orbs only recently appeared in Pact Worlds space, and wherever they appear, purple orbs are nowhere to be found. While the history and relationship between these orbs is unclear, scholars have at least discerned they communicate using the same language and share similar physiology. Their behavior, on the other hand, is quite different from purple orbs; they shun contact with others, rarely make friends, and lie whenever possible, though they aren't especially good at deception, much in the same way purple orbs aren't especially good at diplomacy, despite their best efforts. Some scholars have begun to expect that these two types of orb are somehow enemies of one another, though no records of conflict between them exist, and no sapient orb seems eager to discuss the other type in depth. Green orbs' tendency to lie about most topics further complicates the study of sapient orbs and their apparent enmity. Sapient green orbs are 3 feet in diameter, much like sapient purple orbs, but if asked about their size (or just about any other trait), they always state something slightly inaccurate—three-and-a-half feet, two feet and four inches—whatever they think will be more impressive or confusing for whoever they're addressing. The only trait they never lie about is their color (they all insist that every sapient green orb is exactly the same shade of green, which isn't quite true; there are slight variations). They'll gladly argue about the exact shade of green with anyone around. More than one person has theorized, after such an encounter, that sapient green orbs somehow draw sustenance from engaging others in pointless arguments, but it's more likely they don't need sustenance at all and simply enjoy such pursuits. When a sapient green orb feels they're about to lose an argument, they typically resort to using Excandescent Flash, then fly away.

    "rawText": " Veolisk Veolisks, formidable creatures from remote planets within the Vast, are reminiscent of prehistoric megafauna, despite their relatively smaller size. These lumbering quadrupeds, characterized by their reptilian features and bony exoskeletons, evoke the mystery and fear often associated with ancient colossal creatures. The reason for their seclusion becomes apparent as most xenobiologists posit that the creature's gaze, capable of inducing mental distress in other species, renders habitation near veolisk territory a daunting challenge. Encounters with veolisks near established communities lead to ruthless hunts. The creatures, with their signature Void Gaze ability, have sparked speculation about their lineage. Some theories propose that veolisks descended from ancestors with more potent gaze attacks, earning them the moniker “void basilisks” among those versed in Lost Golarion's ancient folklore. An intriguing hypothesis suggests that millennia ago, destruction-loving cultists of the Devourer might have selectively bred the first veolisks, a narrative predating the Gap. Despite their fearsome reputation, veolisks find utility as guardians for Devourer cult bases and even as pets to individuals embracing the chaos of the universe. Interestingly, veolisks are docile and harmless when equipped with blinders, veils, or other means to nullify their gaze—a quirk rarely explored in cross-cultural attempts at domestication. Surviving on minimal sustenance, veolisks consume a single meal daily, feeding on flesh, fruits, fungus, or any available plant life. The physiological systems of veolisks remain a subject of study among scientists. Theories range from hyperefficient metabolisms to feeding on cosmic radiation, akin to trees photosynthesizing sunlight. A fringe notion suggests veolisks might subsist solely on background arcane energies pervasive throughout the galaxy, challenging the boundaries of scientific understanding.

While that isn't unique among the vast cosmos, the reason is nonetheless curious: a veolisk isn't immune to the effects of a gaze from another veolisk. While older veolisks are more capable of recognizing themselves and controlling their gaze, a young veolisk can be undone with an object as simple as a mirror. "

    "rawText": " Warp Troll Warp trolls appear in areas where powerful magic or cosmic phenomena tear the fabric of space and time. Perhaps originating from another reality entirely, they find themselves trapped in a universe that's at once confusing to them but filled with delicious prey. Warp trolls typically stand approximately 15 feet tall and weigh about 1,500 pounds. Their skin is pale green and partially translucent, showing glowing purple veins and the shadows of misshapen organs inside. Each limb has up to a dozen sharp, glass-like spikes that the trolls can detach and throw. A spike removed in this way regrows within the hour. Warp trolls seem to have an instinctual understanding of Jotun and can learn other languages, but they rarely speak. Noise in general seems to alarm and disturb them, and in combat, they often target the creature making the most noise unless a greater threat presents itself. Unusually for trolls, these creatures possess telepathy with a limited range as well as somewhat complex minds. Getting close enough to communicate telepathically with a warp troll usually means standing within claw's reach, however, and few individuals take such a risk.

While music serves as a cornerstone of virtually every culture, it drives warp trolls to the brink. More than one concert has ended with a sudden attack by enraged warp trolls. No one style seems to affect a warp troll more than another, but the band Danger Skitter insists that they've perfected a “cosmorock” style that drives the creatures away. "

Millions of constituents across various developmental stages animate the exoskeleton of a single apari. At the direction of their queen's chemical signals, individual constituents, most no larger than a grain of rice, adapt to the hive's current needs, assuming diverse forms to fulfill specialized roles and supporting its gestalt biological functions. Once introduced within an ecosystem, an apari asserts itself rapidly. Winged constituents forage for food as the hive itself hunts living prey, tearing its victims open with sharp claws while grub-like constituents writhe into fresh wounds and consume the prey from within. When an apari is threatened, combat-ready drones selflessly rush to defend the hive or to cover its escape.

The worms' hostility toward trespassers and lack of observable speech lead most people to consider them mere beasts, but xenobiologists know the worms' tendrils respond to electromagnetic waves, which they manipulate to see, communicate, and interact with their surroundings. Bioelectric radiation from coral samples recovered from the worms' home reef documents millennia of worm culture and history from even before the Diaspora's formation. Juvenile members of this species are sleek, sinuous, and nimble despite their size. Their electromagnetic manipulation lets them briefly change the molecular structure of water, making it murky like their original depths. Young worms tend to commit brazen attacks, requiring decades of experience to value more complex strategies.

Swarms of worms have flooded the River Between, with some specimens shedding their water dependence to claim new territory in a remarkable instance of accelerated evolution. Scholars suspect that the worms know their ancestral home is at risk of freezing permanently, provoking a surge of expansionism to preserve their species. Worm Dialogue Technologies that allow non-worms to communicate with Diaspora worms are complex and rare but highly effective at stopping a worm's attack. Diaspora worms are reluctant to harm the few creatures who speak their language. "

    "rawText": " Sanimus Slayn In the days before the cataclysm that destroyed all life on Eox, Sanimus Slayn was a happy man. He was one of the very rare elebrians who had no magical aptitude whatsoever, but he was very skilled at tinkering with arms and armor and expertly proficient in their use. Sanimus lived on the continent of Atraskia, where he served as the captain of the guard and huntmaster for Lady Elyssiana Taliac, a member of the elebrian nobility who ruled a large fief along the coast of the Deminas Ocean. Lady Elyssiana wasn't ever powerful enough to be counted among the planet's rulers, but as a well-loved personality, she spent much time in their company. She often invited renowned scholars and ruling nobles to arcane symposiums that were as much elite social functions as academic conferences. Fiercely loyal and devilishly handsome, Sanimus became his lady's close confidant and, according to rumor, her primary consort, granting him power and position by association. For his part, Sanimus only cared about his lady. Due to her connections, Elyssiana knew about the impending sarcesian attacks on Eox before they occurred, and she had the subterranean levels of her castle converted into fortified bunkers large enough for her household, staff, and hundreds of people living in the surrounding countryside. She tasked Sanimus with ensuring that the shelter was stocked with provisions and weapons and that everyone inside and outside the castle knew how to safely reach it in case of an attack. When the Death Wail rent the planet, Elyssiana, her entourage, and a few dozen elebrians had already taken shelter along with a pack of hunting gefs. Sensing this attack was different, Sanimus urged Elyssiana to use her magic to peek outside. Horrified, they watched together as the sky burned, the sea boiled, and every creature trapped outside dropped dead. Elyssiana's psyche shattered at the sight of her world's ruination. Shocked by witnessing the death of her home world, Elyssiana withdrew into deep depression. After months of desperation and despair, one of Elyssiana's powerful friends contacted her via sending , revealing he survived the calamity too and had devised a method for salvation. Sanimus didn't understand the complicated ritual the hooded sage transcribed, but he helped Elyssiana follow it to the letter, carefully mixing herbs and oils, reciting prayers that felt unnatural on the tongue, and preparing the needed materials. The truth became apparent far too late to turn back—they'd dosed the rations with poison, killing everyone present, including Sanimus's beloved gefs. Then, the resulting necromantic burst from this terrible sacrifice turned into fuel for a ritual that transformed Elyssiana into a necrovite—a bone sage capable of surviving the apocalypse. Sanimus's fury reanimated him as a corpsefolk, but only after Elyssiana had already departed or succumbed to her own despair. He has searched for centuries but has never found even a trace of her. Over time, he's forgotten who was truly to blame for the tragedy, alternating between hating himself and the bone sage who tricked Elyssiana into performing the necromantic ritual. Now Sanimus serves Shathrava, who also feels guilt about his deeds in the ancient past and foolishly believes only he can put things right. Shathrava has manipulated Sanimus into blaming the sarcesians as the primary culprit for the cataclysm that struck Eox, therefore causing Elyssiana's death and twisted rebirth. Now known as the Skeletal Soldier, Sanimus was among the first to swear fealty to the new Undying Admiral and wields a magic cutlass gifted to him by his new lord—but he still carries the dueling sword Elyssiana gave him long ago. Campaign Role Sanimus Slayn is the primary villain in Guilt of the Grave World . At the campaign's outset, Sanimus is the ranking Corpse Fleet officer stationed on Cairn, a small piece of the Diaspora asteroid belt in the Pact Worlds. This small chunk of rock isn't a permanent Corpse Fleet base. It's a way station responsible for monitoring probe networks spread throughout the Pact Worlds that Corpse Fleet vessels in the area sometimes use to resupply. The listening post under Sanimus's command detected the mysterious signal described in the adventure's background around the same time it was registered by Ulrikka Clanholdings. Sanimus boards his warship, the Amaranth , charging full speed ahead toward the signal, then chases down the PCs as they fled. Once the PCs arrive on Eox, Sanimus sends orders to secret fleet agents and strike teams on the planet's surface to hunt down the PCs and stop them from interfering in the Corpse Fleet's operations. Meanwhile, Sanimus heads to Barrow to pick up a gravimetric towing device that he plans to use to steal the asteroid facility. This time, Sanimus remains behind in the auxiliary research center while the Amaranth returns to the Drift to retrieve the asteroid. Somewhere in his cold dead heart, Sanimus desperately hopes this ancient signal might have something to do with his lost lady. He wants to be the first to learn the truth of this mystery, whatever it turns out to be. Sanimus starts off as a villain operating behind the scenes. The PCs face off against him in Chapter 5. By then, he has already received intelligence about their capabilities and tactics and is prepared to counter them as best he can. He fights with abandon, showing no mercy or quarter. Loyal to the bitter end, Sanimus fights until destroyed. As the collection of miserable bones that he once were clatter to the floor, his weapons cease to glow with unnatural ire, becoming safe for living creatures to handle.

The plant propagates slowly yet steadily by catapulting an annual yield of brilliant blue seeds spaceward. The imparted momentum provides sufficient velocity for most seeds, aided by their supernatural ability to ignore gravity, to escape into the depths of space. Each seed drifts unremittingly until it encounters an object suitable for sustaining it, whether a wandering asteroid, planetary body, or sizable starship. Once embedded in a fitting surface, a void palm seed germinates rapidly. Upon sprouting, the plant begins drawing nutrients from its surroundings, which periodically become enriched by the decomposing corpses or the oxidizing scraps of the plant's victims.

    "rawText": " Young Host Dragon Innumerable insects follow these lumbering, ravenous dragons wherever they roam, swarming around them and living in the countless orifices along the host dragon's body. The dragon is both a part of the swarm itself and a part of the swarm's ecosystem—the swarm feeds on their body, and the dragon feeds on the swarm in a grotesque, centuries-long cycle that somehow results in the host dragon growing larger and more powerful even if they feed on no other substance in their lifetime. Host dragons draw their power from the primal instincts of insects and, despite their intelligence, often behave like the insects they gather to them. Host dragons despise answering questions and violently defy all attempts others make to understand their nature.

In a twisted mockery of copaxi evolution, clusters of copi fused together to form coposirixes, shambling mounds of mutated copi fused with a partial shell of crystallized waste that crackles and creaks as it moves.

Parcels of mined copi were illegally sold to offworld business ventures trying to develop uses for its gravitational connection, though none of their efforts have succeeded.

Their hulking figures consist primarily of a pair of chain guns merged into the flesh of their large arms. By comparison, their legs are disproportionately small and incapable of bracing completely against the force of their attacks. Daipexes only use their legs when necessary and otherwise rely on their arms to move about to reduce the strain on their leg muscles. Daipexes carry about the entrails of their prey, sometimes dangling loops of intestines from their necks or simply dragging it along the ground. They feed these organs into their arms and, by flexing their muscles there, condense the putrid flesh into ammunition that can then be fired directly from their bodies. While they often have enough ammunition to fire off their arm weapons for hours, in the rare instances that they run out of ammunition mid-combat, they either retrieve more from corpses on the battlefield or sacrifice their own flesh in the name of victory.

    "rawText": " Dreamer Dancing between Liavara's peach-colored clouds are the Dreamers, the psychically gifted cousins of barathus. Not native to Liavara, the Dreamers were originally barathu explorers. They arrived by sailing one of the first living oma-ships long before the Gap. What exactly transformed them is still unknown to this day, though barathus as a people have been extremely protective of their prophetic cousins ever since. The Dreamers lack barathus' ability to combine consciousnesses as well as their collectivist culture. That said, the Dreamers often dance through the skies of Liavara in flotillas together. To most of the Pact Worlds, they're a curiosity. To barathus, they're charges to be protected. The Dreamers themselves seem unconcerned with any such attention, giving neither care nor notice as to what's going on around them.

These prophecies are now muddled and sometimes even contradictory. Still, their dreamy dances and beautiful songs captivate viewers from all across the galaxy. While most admirers are content with the officially licensed recordings that barathus painstakingly produce and remaster in high-fidelity psychic audio, a cottage industry has arisen among those sneaking to Liavara to create their own bootleg recordings.

A gaping mouth opens from the top of the trunk, capable of swallowing most creatures smaller than the moonflower. Moonflowers can move slowly and attack with their powerful roots, but they usually dig deeply into the surrounding ground and remain stationary to ambush prey. Though moonflowers can't speak in the conventional sense, they communicate telepathically with other moonflowers. Those who manage to intercept a moonflower's telepathic communications are assaulted by visions of primeval jungles ruled over by titanic plant life. Whether this vision is a genetic memory or a dream of the future shared by all moonflowers is unknown. Moonflowers first sprouted on a long-dead planet, but their proliferation throughout the galaxy has been perpetuated by both random dispersal and sinister intent. Moonflower groves thrive on Castrovel and other worlds with undisturbed wilderness.

Shipbreakers propel themselves through space, seeking faint electronic signals emitted by starships. After tracking a target, shipbreakers slam into the starship using a powerful breach maneuver and then rip through the hull to get at the crew inside, ingesting passengers, components, and cargo in a vicious gulp that fuels their interplanetary predation. Shipbreakers are especially attracted to batteries and even prioritize eating a fully charged battery over a more nutritious living creature. These batteries remain a permanent component of shipbreakers, storing and retrieving excess caloric energy from the elementals.

They often make themselves known to pure-hearted mortals who are either in the path of an imminent fiendish incursion or else struggling to vanquish a vile foe. They can be obsessively goal oriented and have been known to abandon a stalwart ally to pursue a fiend rather than delay the fight against their target. Once an arqsheth destroys the object of their pursuit or determines that their wielder no longer needs their aid, they typically return to Heaven, but rare circumstances sometimes lead an arqsheth to remain in the Universe for an extended time. These arqsheths might find themselves embarking on long journeys with a loyal starship crew, standing guard over a seemingly abandoned planet, or taking up a post near a Drift beacon. They never reveal their motivation for remaining, and some suspect that arqsheths have a sort of sixth sense that warns of potential threats and leads them to take up such posts.

    "rawText": " Atlapak Atlapaks are aquatic ambush predators renowned for their ability to create a sonic pulse that can stun or kill targets from hundreds of feet away. These enormous arthropods have banded shells, three compound eyes on movable stalks, a dexterous right claw for grasping and tearing, and an oversized, highly specialized left claw that generates a cavitation bubble when it snaps shut, which then implodes with crushing force. The atlapak uses plates on its carapace to direct the resulting sonic burst toward prey with uncanny accuracy. Despite their animalistic intelligence, atlapaks have an instinctive understanding of ballistics and fluid dynamics. Their antennae detect subtle changes in currents and fluid density, allowing them to detect moving targets from a great distance and calibrate their cavitation blasts accordingly. Their compound eyes detect multiple wavelengths of light and provide incredible depth perception comparable to advanced sniper scopes. Atlapaks prefer sheltered burrows that provide commanding views, such as coral reefs or low hills where they can conceal themselves and pick off prey at a distance. Though they typically stay in the silt of their underwater lairs, atlapaks can range far to mate. Historically, a spawning atlapak sticks fertilized eggs onto migrating megafauna that carry their offspring to new environs with unclaimed territory and resources. In the modern era, this behavior has led to eggs being stuck to the hulls of ships, where they can survive even in humid terrestrial environments. Juvenile atlapaks sometimes haunt a jungle or coast before returning to the safety of the ocean. Atlapaks can grow up to 10 feet long, while juveniles are typically at least 5 feet long. Their predatory instincts kick in almost immediately after birth.

As a result, connoisseurs often commission live atlapak shipments to their restaurants despite the danger they present to those who capture, transport, and prepare the meal. The atlapak trade is also illegal or heavily regulated on many planets to protect the species, which have been hunted to near-extinction. "

They bite and claw at anyone who comes near, though no one knows for sure how they come into existence. They take shelter in broken-down reactors and hazardous waste dumps throughout the galaxy. Sometimes, mutant trolls puzzle together bits of tech to craft themselves a jetpack or rocket pod for propulsion to escape these sites and seek gory pleasures elsewhere. These trolls vary greatly in appearance, but they tend to have droopy skin and hair, a side effect of their twisted regenerative powers. One of the few things mutant trolls love is to bask in the glow of a broken reactor system. They take rapturous joy in the feel of radiation washing over their skin—they speak to themselves in hushed tones about ancient kin who filled their bodies with so much radiation that they acquired primal magic powers.

Despite enjoying these sorts of environments, mutant trolls still find loneliness boring and craft temporary ships for themselves that hold together just long enough for a single one-way voyage to other planets. Oddly, mutant trolls seem capable of speech and name these short-lived vessels. These names usually embody things they desire, such as Destroyer Of Life , Gnasher Of Hope , or simply Swiftly It Flies . "

They hitch rides on starships, drift among wrecks and meteors, and lay hidden in junkyards. Their only goal: to repair everything they can get their protoplasm on. Scavenger slimes are believed to be an accidental marriage of technology and magic, built by an extremely advanced civilization as an all-purpose repair gel, only to develop rudimentary sentience and outlive their creators. These creatures have an instinctive drive to repair and rebuild nearly any technological item they encounter. Using their extremely malleable bodies, which excrete a highly specialized resin, scavenger slimes can repair even exceedingly complex pieces of technology. They intuitively understand how to shield themselves from harm and how to operate any weapon they manage to find, aggressively using such armaments to drive any and all creatures away from their neverending repair work.

A surnoch's mouth is deep, funnel-like, and lined with numerous rows of sharp, pointed teeth, which allow it to grind matter down as it chews and melts its way through rock and stone. Surnochs have an innate sense of which minerals their bodies require most and can find these minerals even through miles of rocks. Surnochs excrete condensed forms of these minerals, leaving tunnels full of strange alloys and gem-quality materials in their wake. When multiple surnochs gather together, their appetites synchronize, causing them to hunt for specific minerals en masse.

These dragons grow deposits of pure abysium in their bodies, becoming more radioactive as they age, causing aggression, agitation, and even loneliness since not many creatures can long survive the company of an aging abysium dragon. Abysium dragons frequently turn to pursuits such as augmentation and weapon crafting (to take advantage of their innate power source) and the construction of robots (to keep them company).

    "rawText": " Gwereiad Gwereiads are aloof and enigmatic nymphs who keep to themselves, nestling deep inside the phenomena known as black holes. Whether their solitary nature is an active preference or simply a consequence of their homes is up for debate, as few creatures can brave the gravitational forces of a black hole long enough to make contact with gwereiads. They're rarely hostile unless provoked and occasionally even rescue starships at risk of being devoured by their homes. Gwereiads adore art and music, though their tastes tend toward the strange and avant-garde. While most nymphs aren't overtly religious, gwereiads devote themselves to esoteric spirituality focused on space-time.

However, even their most learned sages don't know the precise nature of a vorthuul's creation. One leading theory posits that when a hapless creature falls into the reality warping forces of a black hole, its body and spirit are split into parallel quantum states, forever occupying one space but never to be whole again. Another theory suggests vorthuuls are former solarians who abandoned the balance central to their philosophy; such solarians unwittingly sunder their entire beings, doomed forever to be unable to resolve the conflict within themselves.

The dragon is both a part of the swarm itself and a part of the swarm's ecosystem—the swarm feeds on their body, and the dragon feeds on the swarm in a grotesque, centuries-long cycle that somehow results in the host dragon growing larger and more powerful even if they feed on no other substance in their lifetime. Host dragons draw their power from the primal instincts of insects and, despite their intelligence, often behave like the insects they gather to them.

While exploring a potential new home in the Vast, they were overrun by a strange fungus that consumed everything they touched. The giants' size protected them from immediate annihilation, but most could only watch as the mycelium's blue-green tendrils covered their new home. In desperation, the giants devoted all their resources to science to find some way to eradicate the fungus. Instead, they learned how to adapt. The giants began living symbiotically with the fungus, grafting it onto their skin and incorporating it into their technology. Now, these giants explore the galaxy as scientists and preservers of myriad ecosystems. While they're most often found providing their scientific expertise to other species, a growing movement of daredevil explorers known as sporerunners travel some of the most dangerous locations in the galaxy on a quest to find a planet they can call home.

Most of Vengreneer's peers have scoffed at the idea, but some secretly fear that discovering the fungus can communicate might dissuade the giants from using the fungus in their technology, hampering their continued scientific development.

    "rawText": " Emissary-Class Infiltrator Robot While many of the earliest infiltrator robots were designed for more direct stealth missions, the emissary-class infiltrator robots were created for more insidious tasks. These include planting evidence, spreading rumors and propaganda, and generally creating unrest or fomenting open rebellion. Programmed with a sophisticated virtual intelligence and constructed with the ability to disguise itself as a creature of flesh and blood, an emissary-class infiltrator robot can wreak havoc on an organization or settlement without ever having to engage in combat. They are considered the ultimate tool in corporate or governmental espionage and fetch a high price on most illegal markets. Emissary-Class Infiltrator Robot Source Alien Core pg. 161 Perception +24; darkvision Languages Common; plus up to three other languages Skills Acrobatics +23, Computers +21, Deception +26, Diplomacy +23, Intimidation +23, Society +21, Stealth +23, Thievery +23 Str +1 Dex +5 Con +2 Int +3 Wis +1 Cha +7 Adaptive Disguise An emissary-class infiltrator robot is covered in a layer of synthetic programmable skin that counts as a disguise kit. The robot can alter the skin over the course of a minute to Impersonate a Medium humanoid ancestry or specific person (if it has information about that person or has previously interacted with them). If the robot makes a retractable spike Strike or uses Morphing Visage, it takes a –4 circumstance penalty to its Deception DCs and skill checks to Impersonate against any who witnessed the action.

With the rise of nanotechnology, clever scientists discovered a way to make this material infinitely programmable. Luckily, synthskin isn't commercially available, and the methods of its construction are kept as tightly held secrets by corporations and governments alike. "

Metaphysicians often explain wyspirias in contrast against iridias as spectra emissaries; where iridias travel the galaxy to share gifts of technology and information, wyspirias instead come to mortal worlds on a mission to collect and preserve mortal art and knowledge, storing it within themselves or bringing it back to the Drift for reasons as of yet unknown. Wyspirias' glass-like bodies include a cascade of tentacle-like cords descending from their waists, which they use to plug themselves directly into both people and machines. Because their tentacles can resemble the outstretched roots of a small, floating tree, the librarian spectra are sometimes known as “trees of knowledge.” They use their networks to transfer data and share emotional or sensory experiences between participants. Though accounts of wyspirias appearing on mortal worlds are extremely rare, they've been known to sometimes involve themselves as mediators between warring civilizations. They work to ease tense negotiations at peace talks by connecting the opposing delegates to one another, enabling various parties to experience each other's perspectives. It's widely believed that spectra only dispatch wyspirias to intervene in mortal conflicts when a war could result in the loss of important information, prevent the discovery of future innovations, or interfere with the Drift itself.

    "rawText": " Adult Akashic Dragon Though rarely encountered outside their crumbling, relic-filled lairs, Akashic dragons occasionally live in hubs of knowledge, such as bustling space stations or cities. These dragons, bestowed with a direct connection to the Akashic Record, are arrogant curators of knowledge, assuming (often correctly) that no other being could possibly have a deeper understanding of the universe's secrets. Akashic dragons spend extensive time in the Akashic Record, often emerging after what they perceive as many days while mere hours have passed for the rest of the galaxy.

The swirl of constant uploads and downloads near the Akashic dragon make attempts to Recall Knowledge unpredictable. A creature other than an akashic dragon that enters or begins its turn in the area must attempt a DC 28 Will save. Regardless of the result of the saving throw, the creature is temporarily immune to this dragon's Akashic interference for 1 minute. Critical Success For 1 round, when the creature attempts to Recall Knowledge, it gains a +3 status bonus to its check. Success The creature is unaffected. Failure For 1 round, when the creature attempts to Recall Knowledge, it takes a –3 status penalty to its check. Critical Failure As failure, but the effect lasts 1 minute. Deflecting Lasers Reaction (occult) Trigger The dragon is critically hit by an attack; Effect The young Akashic dragon raises a web of deflecting lasers using the eyes embedded all over their body, gaining resistance 15 to all damage against the triggering attack and absorbing some of the blow's energy, recharging their Akashic Barrage.

    "rawText": " Asteray Thought to be merely mischievous tricksters, asterays are in fact fey born where the Void and First World overlap. Gifted with the innate ability to survive in space, asterays suffer from extreme wanderlust and an overwhelming desire to stave off boredom, with a desperate thirst for amusement being the prime motivation of most of their kind. They find themselves attracted to interesting stellar phenomena, from the swirls in gas giants to the interplay of stellar debris in an asteroid field. By floating through space, asterays gather enough sustenance to survive from their innate ability to consume latent cosmic radiation. However, asterays have one simple nutritional need that makes them a terror of the space lanes: organic matter. As space is all but devoid of organic elements for consumption, asterays resort to trailing starships, often by riding in their wake and tormenting the crew until they either abandon their posts or descend into chaos. Once an asteray has sufficiently driven a crew to despair, they enter the vessel and consume the corpses of the fallen. Luckily—or perhaps not—for travelers, asterays typically find the consumption of living creatures distasteful, though their alien mindsets open them to using their vacuous ability to consume matter on active foes when threatened. Most asterays hibernate for months or even years at a time, floating in the wrecks of abandoned ships until the cosmic eddies of a passing ship stirs them from their torpor.

These false sights, along with the fey's natural ability to create sensor “songs,” have led starships from across countless civilizations to their doom. Groups of asterays, formed into choirs, often weave their songs to entice larger starships to enter truly dangerous stellar regions, such as asteroid belts or close to dying stars. Giving these crews ample time to escape, asterays silently board the derelicts and consume all organic matter before departing as discreetly as they arrived. "

    "rawText": " Ferrofluid Magneto-Cluster Magneto-clusters are usually created when several smaller ferrofluid oozes combine. There have, however, been documented cases of these creatures spontaneously appearing after large industrial accidents. Like their smaller “cousins,” magnetocluster oozes seek out sources of electromagnetism. They also search for and consume magnetic objects and metals capable of being magnetized. They completely disregard organic life and usually are only a danger when a life-form doesn't want to relinquish their magnetic material. Some clusters consume so much metal and objects they're mistaken for scavenger slimes. Any metal consumed by a magnetocluster immediately becomes magnetic. As living magnetic accelerators, ferrofluid magneto-cluster oozes are capable of launching the metal they collect at high speeds as a defense mechanism. They do so at such high velocities as to make even a simple metal shard accelerate fast enough to puncture high-tech ballistic armor.

The fluids contained inside these oozes are more refined than anything created industrially and can be used in dampeners to reduce starship vibrations and impact damage in general. Using ferrofluid ooze substances in this way creates items with far greater capacity than normal but isn't without its dangers, since even a small leak risks turning into an ooze infestation. "

    "rawText": " Haeshi-Shaa Haeshi-shaas are relatively new members of the Dominion of the Black. These long-lived creatures shift unpredictably between a liquid and a gaseous form in a mysterious cycle that lasts their entire lives. In their liquid haeshi form, they're a churning, chunky fluid, while in their vaporous shaa form, they're more akin to hazy brown fog. Regardless of their form, they hum with atonal harmonies that cause great discomfort in others. Haeshi-shaas serve as a sort of priest caste for the Dominion of the Black, each form preaching a doctrine of entropy and annihilation, though with slightly different nuances between each form. Haeshis tend toward assertive, aggressive practices, while shaas are meditative, often spending many months or years in contemplation. Haeshi-shaas believe that the most perfect and divine state of any object or being is complete separation into its most basic, individual particles. They claim (dubiously) that they can see, even predict, the journey of all things as they travel toward this ultimate entropic end. In truth, haeshi-shaas can't even predict when they'll shift into their alternate form. Some have tried to catalyze the change by seeking out specific types of life experience or knowledge, but despite the many claims to the contrary, there are no verified instances of a haeshi-shaa forcing the change. Most choose to simply await their next transformation, during which time they have many centuries to spread the Dominion's disturbing doctrines and pursue their inscrutable agendas. Haeshi Form A haeshi-shaa in their haeshi form is aggressive and persistent, unlikely to back down from an argument or a fight unless their life is in danger. While aggressive, haeshis are far from foolish; they prepare carefully for any encounter and often have dozens of nested contingencies to fall back on should any situation evolve beyond their control.

Whether they seek to cause the change, or wait for it to occur, none can truly claim to understand the transformation. Haeshi-shaas live for about 25,000 years, and most will shift many hundreds or thousands of times in their life cycles. Eventually, they deteriorate and completely dissipate, their particles spreading across the cosmos. A haeshi-shaa can't predict this final cycle any more than they can predict their other transformations, but a haeshi-shaa more than 20,000 years old tends to travel the galaxy at a faster pace, as if trying to see it all before their inevitable end.

Using the hunted creatures' bodies to break the fall, ranoneks slam them into the ground below to reduce their insides to pulp before feeding on their blood. A ranonek's digestive system utilizes several highly compressive tracts that allow them to squeeze the blood from smaller prey. When another meal tries to fly away, they can hock up and shoot the dried pellets containing the remains of their desiccated meals, knocking down prey before it gets too far away. Those documenting these remains have confirmed that these huge beasts prefer dragon prey over any other; this comes as no surprise given that ranoneks can drain many young dragons in under a minute and swallow entire dragonkin whole.

It rampages across its territories, consuming everything smaller than itself and taking delight in the destruction it leaves in its wake. It's difficult to hide from a skarak, as it'll rip down fortifications and smash through concrete walls to get at prey cowering inside buildings. It's even more difficult to run from a skarak since it can spit a corrosive webbing that magically binds its prey to itself, allowing it to pull its prey across any distance to within reach of its waiting maw. A skarak possesses a terrible cunning to complement its destructive might. It often watches a targeted settlement for days, analyzing defenses before launching a devastating offensive. It's typically a solitary creature except when training a newly hatched brood to hunt. During this period, it ranges ahead of its young, rampaging through densely populated areas and leaving wounded, weakened targets behind it. Survivors of the initial rampage soon discover they aren't the lucky ones as the skarak young come after, devouring all in their path.

A skarak that encounters such designs will often stare at it for extended periods of time as if fascinated. The more complex the pattern, the better. People who live within a skarak's hunting radius often decorate their structures with patterned murals or sculptures of scrap metal and wire, which typically dissuade the skarak from destroying the structure. This has been known to backfire, as skaraks are harsh critics of art that doesn't match their taste, and their reviews leave no trace of the offending piece or its creator. "

Cosmic dragons are wise, social, and patient beings, accepting of all whom they come across; they see all creatures as equal components of the universe and are just as likely to be found discussing astrophysics in the company of scholars as they are to be found lamenting the twists and turns of fate in the company of the downtrodden.

These creations are grown, not built, but they're neither cybernetics nor biotech—rather, something in between. Deh-nolos seek to understand all technology they encounter, and they believe it's their right to consume the brain of anyone they think might help them better understand an unfamiliar device. Then again, deh-nolos have no qualms about consuming brains for nearly any reason, seeing all forms of life outside the Dominion as lesser beings. While mostly organic, deh-nolos can concentrate their shimmering liquid metal secretions into foul crystals that they can use as projectiles or mechanical components for their twisted inventions. A casual onlooker might assume these creations are biotechnological in nature, as they often look like atrophied organs and mutated body parts held together by seemingly crude or incomplete circuitry. Those who attempt to incorporate deh-nolo technology into their bodies as augmentations typically experience terrible pain and grisly deaths, even if they somehow manage to isolate or drain the toxins naturally produced by a deh-nolo's alien flesh. Even less intrusive experiments with deh-nolo technology are unpredictable and dangerous, and the results of a “successful” outcome are disturbing at best.

    "rawText": " Othinni Along Embroi's perilous seas, residents speak in hushed tones of the othinni. Considered by some to be a myth, the enormous, squid-like aberrations supposedly bear sinister glowing runes suggestive of an infernal lineage. Those dragged into the deep by their writhing tentacles and swallowed by their gaping maws are said to go straight to Hell, their final screams fueling the legends. The myths are true. Othinni possess a cruel intelligence and dominating influence over the minds of mortals. Survivors suffer disturbing visions, intense feelings of fear and confusion, and visions of unholy fire burning atop the waves. Hearing the insidious psychic screech of an othinni or sailing into their massive shadow is a frightful experience for anyone braving the oceans of Embroi. Angels and their allies hunt othinni with massive holy harpoons and enchanted silver nets. One legendary hunt is recorded in the documentary film Umiqon (produced by Zo! Media), which is named for the 40-foot tall monster brought down by four Knights of Iomedae.

Mariners speak of burning waves and creeping shadows when othinni draw near, but they often flee before they can see anything more. "

    "rawText": " Warpstitcher Warpstitchers are self-proclaimed guardians of existence, holding the belief that they were created by the gods to sew together the space between alternate realities. These horrifying aberrations relentlessly hunt anything they suspect abuses magic or technology to change the fabric of the multiverse. Once they find their quarry, they wait only long enough to confirm their suspicions before attacking. Potential threats—a neophyte spellcaster trying their first cantrips, an academic theorist exploring interstellar travel—instead earn a telepathic warning of what awaits should they pursue their efforts too far. Everything other than threats (potential or otherwise) is a possible tool, a target for warpstitcher lies and coercion. Their mere appearance is fuel for nightmares, with insectile limbs supporting a massive, bulbous torso. From their back spring five multi-segmented limbs ending in wicked claws threaded with the very stuff of reality that they use to skewer their prey, who they then sew into their bodies. Such unfortunate creatures quickly dissolve, possibly sustaining the warpstitchers, though whether that's through their flesh, thoughts, or alternate reality potential is unknown. Those few who survive are plagued by disturbing, haunting visions; a smaller percentage instead see visions of happier possible lives, gaining peace and sometimes unprecedented witchwarper powers.

Such an AI might have also accumulated valuable data on its computer servers. However, PCs should treat this tech carefully, as a malevolent AI's hoard is just as likely to hide a dormant virus or contingency backup of the AI's personality. Tech Allies A malevolent AI quickly discovers that attempting to manufacture allies by copying themself instead gives birth to several unique creatures, with competing priorities and all the abilities of their progenitor. Such a process can produce a host of rivals and maybe a few grudging allies, but it often devolves into a battle for influence and resources. AIs are resource-heavy programs that don't share well. "

The dragon is both a part of the swarm itself and a part of the swarm's ecosystem—the swarm feeds on their body, and the dragon feeds on the swarm in a grotesque, centuries-long cycle that somehow results in the host dragon growing larger and more powerful even if they feed on no other substance in their lifetime. Host dragons draw their power from the primal instincts of insects and, despite their intelligence, often behave like the insects they gather to them.

    "rawText": " Haeshi-Shaa Haeshi-shaas are relatively new members of the Dominion of the Black. These longlived creatures shift unpredictably between a liquid and a gaseous form in a mysterious cycle that lasts their entire lives. In their liquid haeshi form, they're a churning, chunky fluid, while in their vaporous shaa form, they're more akin to hazy brown fog. Regardless of their form, they hum with atonal harmonies that cause great discomfort in others. Haeshi-shaas serve as a sort of priest caste for the Dominion of the Black, each form preaching a doctrine of entropy and annihilation, though with slightly different nuances between each form. Haeshis tend toward assertive, aggressive practices, while shaas are meditative, often spending many months or years in contemplation. Haeshi-shaas believe that the most perfect and divine state of any object or being is complete separation into its most basic, individual particles. They claim (dubiously) that they can see, even predict, the journey of all things as they travel toward this ultimate entropic end. In truth, haeshi-shaas can't even predict when they'll shift into their alternate form. Some have tried to catalyze the change by seeking out specific types of life experience or knowledge, but despite the many claims to the contrary, there are no verified instances of a haeshi-shaa forcing the change. Most choose to simply await their next transformation, during which time they have many centuries to spread the Dominion's disturbing doctrines and pursue their inscrutable agendas. Shaa Form While demonstrably more powerful while in shaa form, haeshi-shaas tend to spend this portion of their lives in careful contemplation. A shaa interrupted in their contemplation is a vengeful enemy indeed.

Whether they seek to cause the change, or wait for it to occur, none can truly claim to understand the transformation. Haeshi-shaas live for about 25,000 years, and most will shift many hundreds or thousands of times in their life cycles. Eventually, they deteriorate and completely dissipate, their particles spreading across the cosmos. A haeshi-shaa can't predict this final cycle any more than they can predict their other transformations, but a haeshi-shaa more than 20,000 years old tends to travel the galaxy at a faster pace, as if trying to see it all before their inevitable end.

    "rawText": " Oma Also known as space whales, omas project powerful magical electromagnetic fields that protect them from both vacuum and toxic atmospheres while allowing them to feed. Omas gain sustenance from the particulate rings and dense atmospheres of gas giants, although exactly which substances are nutritious to an oma is still unknown. Studying a feeding oma isn't without danger. Omas sometimes accidentally swallow drones and small starships, such as fighters and interceptors, and they've been known to do so deliberately when provoked. Most omas have been observed traveling alone. On occasion, omas form pods of three to five individuals and migrate across systems, on currents and schedules only they know. In very rare cases, omas gather among the rings of a planet in massive numbers. Their energy fields intermingle and react with local gases to light up large areas of space in a multicolored show. Their most enigmatic yet well known feature is their starsong. Traveling through space for billions of miles, the starsong is a haunting telepathic melody. Most people perceive starsong as crooning, slow and mournful. No one can agree on the details, suggesting that each listener hears something different. Attempts to translate starsong have failed thus far, stumping even the most brilliant magic and linguistics experts. Since the Drift Crisis, for unknown reasons pods of omas have begun bombarding Drift beacons with a seemingly new starsong frequency, in some cases causing catastrophic malfunctions.

These dragons grow deposits of pure abysium in their bodies, becoming more radioactive as they age, causing aggression, agitation, and even loneliness since not many creatures can long survive the company of an aging abysium dragon. Abysium dragons frequently turn to pursuits such as augmentation and weapon crafting (to take advantage of their innate power source) and the construction of robots (to keep them company).

    "rawText": " Zo! The person who would eventually become a galactic superstar, media mogul, and fearsome bone sage wasn't always accustomed to fame and fortune. Born to an unremarkable family of elebrian serfs in rural Eox, Ahmzovar was a precocious child. He showed early signs of arcane aptitude like many of his ancestors, but he also had a flair for drama rarely seen in cerebral elebrian culture. Following his dream to become a world-famous entertainer, Ahmzovar enamored anyone who saw him perform with his sparkling personality and theatrical antics. Many wealthy aristocrats became his patrons, allowing him to travel the world and even amass his own outrageous fortune. Even though Ahmzovar could've simply lived a life of luxury, he stayed connected to his roots, supporting his family and pouring money into public works. Eventually, he was invited to take an active part in the planet's governance, and he quickly became a popular leader among the working class. No matter what projects he involved himself in, Ahmzovar always seemed to make friends across political aisles. Then the trouble with Damiar and Iovo turned everything upside down. Fearful of more sarcesian attacks, Ahmzovar helped fund research into a superweapon, enabling the project that would soon create the Death Wail. The terrible weapon was unveiled alongside a jingoistic song-and-dance routine choreographed by Ahmzovar himself. The performance inspired a near-unanimous vote among Eox's ruling sages to deploy the weapon. When the Death Wail was fired, Ahmzovar watched through a powerful arcane telescope from the tallest tower of one of his castles located on a private island in the southwestern Deminas Ocean, not far from the coast of Atraskia and several new sub-nautical facilities the government had recently finished building. From his privileged viewing platform, Ahmzovar witnessed the energies rebound toward Eox as a shock wave rippled through the planet's upper atmosphere. Sensing something catastrophic about to happen, he activated magical barriers around his estate, saving himself and his retinue from disaster. Trapped on his private island after the cataclysm, Ahmzovar used magical communication to reach out to others who'd survived, and from these exchanges, he learned the extent of the disaster. When his island's resources had finally been stretched to the limit, he tearfully made the decision to leave his staff behind as he made the transition into becoming an undead necrovite since only he had enough power to perform the necessary rites. After the destruction of his world, Ahmzovar fell into a deep melancholy for centuries, remaining in isolation inside his lonely castle as his role in the near extinction of Eox's people weighed on his mind. He blamed himself for the Death Wail's unforeseen consequences. Trapped in denial by grief, Ahmzovar engaged in mental exercises, mind games, and illusionary scenarios over and over and over, trying to figure out some way to atone for his mistakes. His chance would finally come centuries later when news reached him that a sub-nautical facility of yore had been rediscovered, with a population of living elebrians inside! His mind racing at the possibilities of redemption, Ahmzovar returned to public life as Zo!, distancing himself from his former identity and positioning himself to gain control of the newly dubbed Halls of the Living. In the centuries that followed, Zo! reformed the Halls of the Living into a paradise for the elebrians (and eventually others) living there as full- time entertainers while producing content exciting enough to keep the bone sages—and the rest of the galaxy—watching and willing to shell out credits. In his flawed way, Zo! is still a champion of the people. He keeps his past hidden from all but his closest confidants. Zo! is a pacifist who avoids combat, but if forced into a corner, he relies on spells and special talents to survive until he can escape danger. Zo! is one of the original bone sages of Eox, and despite his comedic antics and friendly demeanor, no person in recorded history has ever survived a duel with the undead media mogul. Zo! handles most of his conflicts legally. A team of the best lawyers in the galaxy is at his beck and call should any legal trouble arise. Campaign Role Zo! provides comedic relief during Chapter 3 of Guilt of the Grave World while putting the PCs through their paces as part of an annual Zo! Media Productions extravaganza. At this point in the adventure, Zo! is aloof, playing the role of a famous media personality who's found promising new talent he can hire for cheap, but he doesn't take much of a personal interest in the PCs. Shortly after the PCs' arrival, Zo! learns through his various rumor mills about his rising stars and their run- in with the Corpse Fleet. Once he realizes that the PCs share his interest in living elebrians, he steps in to act as more of a mentor figure for the heroes. Zo! loathes the Corpse Fleet and their depraved mission, so he's more than happy to gift items, pay for services, and sponsor training for the PCs as they prepare to challenge the undead supremacists. Zo! would rather act behind the scenes than get directly involved in the conflict, and no doubt he's already formed several contingency plans in case the PCs fail. Zo!

    "rawText": " Oscriss The menacing war machines known as the oscriss are found only in the ancient sites associated with the First Ones. Resembling two stacked pyramids with a white energy core of unknown composition, oscriss infuriate foes by routinely teleporting across the battlefield. Found wandering alone throughout Aballonfs First One cities, the war machines were later identified in locations outside the Pact Worlds, lending credence to theories of the First Onesf expansion efforts throughout the cosmos. The oscriss defy proper engagement, staying far away from their foes and unleashing coruscating beams of energy that slice off the limbs of those unlucky enough to engage with them. They meticulously render their foes apart at extreme range using pinpoint accuracy. If pressured into a close-range engagement, they can unleash a blast of chronal energy to slow their attackers and allow themselves the time to better reposition and continue their dismembering bombardment. Like other constructs of the First Ones, these guardians refuse to communicate and defy almost all attempts to override or hack their programming. Some of the galaxyfs finest minds have managed to temporarily overcome the intricate programming within the oscriss, though such intrusions are quickly detected and repelled, indicating that an evolving intelligence dwells within each of the strange machines. When engaged at multiple vectors, it becomes easy to overwhelm an oscrissfs detection grid and reactions. Anacite scholars propose that the constructs were fashioned to battle foes who engaged strictly in two-dimensional warfare, and while the oscriss themselves are exceptionally capable of acting in three dimensions, they battle as though their foes could engage them only in two. Itfs speculated that the unique tactics and weapons employed by the oscriss are intended to deal with one specific threat: the planashars of the Planashar Dominion. The planashars hail from a different reality known as the Infinite Loop that has only two dimensions. Theyfve recently slowly begun invading the galaxy, taking on the title of Those Who Converge and attacking Aballonian First Ones cities and the solar settlement of Noma. That the oscriss are intended to battle them only provides more evidence of some connection between the planashars and the First Ones. Because the oscriss are accustomed to fighting beings that exist only in two.dimensional space, theyfre vulnerable to tactics involving three dimensions. attacking from multiple angles, for example.

When Starfinders first boarded Cache , they encountered many strange sights, eventually coming across an oscriss that barred their path. Though they escaped from the threat, the Starfinder Society barred exploration of that portion of Cache until further analysis. A subsequent release of the Starfinder Chronicles cataloged the likely connection between these mysterious sentinels and the enigmatic First Ones. Full Stop. Z Minus 10 Feet. An oscriss is an incredibly potent foe, able to stand toe-to-toe with the most powerful creatures in the cosmos. However, it's programmed to battle threats that operate in two dimensions, and its tactics tend to rely on two-dimensional thinking. This doesn't mean that it can't operate and react in three dimensions, more that the oscriss interprets its foes as always battling in a two-dimensional environment. Creative combat decisions or roleplaying actions that emphasize the use of a third dimension against an oscriss should be rewarded. "

    "rawText": " Terror Of Ukulam When a massive ooze-like being emerged from the polluted caverns of Castrovel's industrial moon, Elindrae, the planet's leaders made the mistake of assuming the ooze posed no threat to Castrovel itself. When the ooze destroyed several of the moon's shipyards, then launched itself through space to the remote reaches of Ukulam, they made the mistake of assuming they had time to quarantine the threat in that continent's remote wilderness. When its radiation began to spread, and longdead elindrian cultists rose from their nest-necropolises beneath the Singing Range to worship the ooze, the planet's leaders finally understood they couldn't ignore it. They called it the Terror of Ukulam. They still don't understand quite what it is, why it exists, or what it wants. The Terror is an enormous ooze-like thing, somewhat resembling layered flaps of oily dark green flesh. It conceals its only anatomical feature—a large purple eye— beneath its undulating surface. The creature spends most of its time floating in deep subterranean caverns or ocean trenches, remaining immobile for days at a time, then suddenly traversing a great distance, almost always in a straight line, before stopping again. These stops are seemingly random, but they've displaced settlements with increasing regularity. The vengeful worshippers who follow the Terror's path are almost as dangerous as the radiation it spreads, though their reasons for following it are as inscrutable as the Terror itself. Thanks to the nature of atomic energy and especially atomic weapons, Castrovel's scientists have deduced that the radioactive Terror is likely to cause as much destruction in death as it has caused in life—or perhaps more. Even if the combined military might of Castrovel and its allies was sufficient to defeat the Terror, these scientists have warned that they need more time to study the Terror and assess the risks of destroying it outright. Of course, every day that passes is another day that more elindrians flock to the Terror, and yet more victims cross its destructive path.

There's no known instance of the Terror communicating with elindrians, though it's certainly capable of doing so. The number of elindrians who follow in the Terror's wake—or even get close enough to expose themselves to its radiation as they spread violence across the planet—is steadily increasing. Terrible Origins Speculation about the Terror's origins has led only to confusion and despair. Some believe it's an intentional creation, perhaps a biological weapon grown in a hidden lab on Elindrae. Others believe it's a sort of amalgamated mass of toxins and magic waste. Some point to the region where it landed—the Singing Range of Ukulam—and suggest it originally came from someplace deep beneath Castrovel's surface. While many have balked at these claims, preferring to think a creature so terrible must have come from the Vast or perhaps rode to Elindrae on a newly opened Drift lane, the Terror's strange connection to the elindrian cultists suggests its history is somehow tied to Castrovel.

    "rawText": " Illumantula Though it only recently appeared in the shattered red deserts of the planet Akiton, the so-called illumantula has already become the stuff of local legend and folklore. Emerging shortly after the crash of the mysterious First Ones vessel now only known as the Wreck of the Returned, the illumantula was so named by the shobhad desert guides who first encountered the creature and compared it to the deadly spiders of the Akitonian glaciers. Other Pact Worlds citizens have taken to the name, as the closest descriptive title for the being has simply been “a spider made of light.” Content—for now—to spend its days wandering the Wreck of the Returned and the immediately surrounding area, the illumantula has only had a handful of meaningful engagements since its appearance. The first was against a group of Hellknights of the Order of the Eclipse, where the illumantula systematically unmade 80 of their best-trained troops in under two minutes. Only weeks after the engagement, a group of Stewards attempting to enter the Wreck of the Returned were discovered and engaged at the periphery of the illumantula's patrol path. Only two of 12 commandos managed to escape, and their accounts of the illumantula and its powers are contradictory, leaving the Stewards unable to make effective plans for further encounters. A strict quarantine has been set up to match the illumantula's patrol path, as calculated by the meticulous anacites of Investigation Site A01. The Aballonian constructs know the being to be related to the First Ones and dedicate their time to finding a means of communicating with the swarm of technological bits that patrol the outer wastes of the crashed starship. So far, they've had no success, and they've sent out an urgent call for linguistics and computers experts from across the Pact Worlds to travel to Akiton and aid their research. Where the anacites continue their experiments, scholars of Eloritu have uncovered a disturbing connection between the illumantula and the concept of alternate realities. Somehow, the actions of the illumantula produce fixed points in reality, where the unique powers of creatures with greater connections to the multiverse are somehow stymied or forced to adhere to the illumantula's will. The reason for this phenomenon remains a mystery, though one the anacites seem blissfully ignorant to explore. The appearance of the illumantula has led to the belief that it's a protector for the ancient technology of the mysterious First Ones. Similarities between the illumantula's technological bits and extracted data from Aballon have all but confirmed this theory. However, the association begs the question: is there just one illumantula, or is it merely one of many such highly advanced guardian constructs for the First Ones, a species who might be beyond anything the Pact Worlds could contend with?

They see the illumantula as fulfilling the role of a fabled Akitonian myth known as the Remaker: a being who'll undo the world's ecological damage and bring forth a green and bountiful world in its wake. Younger generations have shunned this belief and instead profess that the wreck is a danger to Akiton and the wider Pact Worlds and that whatever is inside must be stopped before it has time to take root. Wreck of the Returned The sudden impact of a starship on the surface of Akiton left the Pact Worlds stunned, and only a few organizations capitalized on the chaos to venture within to acquire some of the technology inside. However, since these pilfering parties escaped their ventures, the illumantula emerged from deep within the vessel to patrol the wreck's outer edges. Now perhaps the most potent creature on all of Akiton, even the Pact Council is unsure how to proceed with this threat at the heart of their system. "
